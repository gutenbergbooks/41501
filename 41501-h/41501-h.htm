<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>INNER STATE AND OUTER FORM</small></h2>


<p>"Human Nature" is a term most frequently
used and yet but little understood.
The average person knows in a general way
what he and others mean when this term is
employed, but very few are able to give an
off-hand definition of the term or to state
what in their opinion constitutes the real essence
of the thought expressed by the familiar
phrase. We are of the opinion that the
first step in the process of correct understanding
of any subject is that of acquaintance
with its principal terms, and, so, we
shall begin our consideration of the subject
of Human Nature by an examination of the
term used to express the idea itself.</p>

<p>"Human," of course, means "of or pertaining
to man or mankind." Therefore,
Human Nature means the <i>nature</i> of man or
mankind. "Nature," in this usage, means:
"The natural disposition of mind of any person;
temper; personal character; individual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>constitution; the peculiar mental characteristics
and attributes which serve to distinguish
one person from another."</p>

<p>Thus we see that the essence of the <i>nature</i>
of men, or of a particular human being, is
the <i>mind</i>, the mental qualities, characteristics,
properties and attributes. Human
Nature is then a phase of psychology and
subject to the laws, principles and methods
of study, examination and consideration
of that particular branch of science.</p>

<p>But while the general subject of psychology
includes the consideration of the inner workings
of the mind, the processes of thought,
the nature of feeling, and the operation of
the will, the special subject of Human Nature
is concerned only with the question of
character, disposition, temperament, personal
attributes, etc., of the individuals making
up the race of man. Psychology is general&mdash;Human
Nature is particular. Psychology
is more or less abstract&mdash;Human Nature
is concrete. Psychology deals with laws,
causes and principles&mdash;Human Nature deals
with effects, manifestations, and expressions.</p>

<p>Human Nature expresses itself in two gen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>eral
phases, i.e., (1) the phase of Inner
States; and (2) the phase of Outer Forms.
These two phases, however, are not separate
or opposed to each other, but are complementary
aspects of the same thing. There is always
an action and reaction between the Inner
State and the Outer Form&mdash;between the
Inner Feeling and the Outer Expression. If
we know the particular Inner State we may
infer the appropriate Outer Form; and if we
know the Outer Form we may infer the Inner
State.</p>

<p>That the Inner State affects the Outer
Form is a fact generally acknowledged by
men, for it is in strict accordance with the
general experience of the race. We know
that certain mental states will result in imparting
to the countenance certain lines and
expressions appropriate thereto; certain peculiarities
of carriage and manner, voice and
demeanor. The facial characteristics, manner,
walk, voice and gestures of the miser will
be recognized as entirely different from that
of the generous person; those of the coward
differ materially from those of the brave
man; those of the vain are distinguished from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
those of the modest. We know that certain
mental attitudes will produce the corresponding
physical expressions of a smile, a frown,
an open hand, a clenched fist, an erect spine
or bowed shoulders, respectively. We also
know that certain feelings will cause the eye
to sparkle or grow dim, the voice to become
resonant and positive or to become husky and
weak; according to the nature of the feelings.</p>

<p>Prof. Wm. James says: "What kind of
emotion of fear would be left if the feeling
neither of trembling lips nor of weakened
limbs, neither of goose-flesh nor of visceral
stirrings, were present, it is quite impossible
for me to think. Can one fancy the state of
rage and picture no ebullition in the chest, no
flushing of the face, no dilation of the nostrils,
no clenching of the teeth, no impulse to vigorous
action, but in their stead limp muscles,
calm breathing, and a placid face?"</p>

<p>Prof. Halleck says: "All the emotions
have well-defined muscular expression. Darwin
has written an excellent work entitled,
<i>The Expression of the Emotions in Man and
Animals</i>, to which students must refer for a
detailed account of such expression. A very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
few examples must suffice here. In all the exhilarating
emotions, the eyebrows, the eyelids,
the nostrils, and the angles of the mouth
are raised. In the depressing passions it is
the reverse. This general statement conveys
so much truth, that a careful observer can
read a large part of the history of a human
being written in the face. For this reason
many phrenologists have wisely turned physiognomists.
Grief is expressed by raising
the inner ends of the eyebrows, drawing
down the corners of the mouth, and transversely
wrinkling the middle part of the forehead.
In Terra del Fuego, a party of natives
conveyed to Darwin the idea that a certain
man was low-spirited, by pulling down
their cheeks in order to make their faces
long. Joy is expressed by drawing backward
and upward the corners of the mouth.
The upper lip rises and draws the cheeks upward,
forming wrinkles under the eyes. The
elevation of the upper lip and the nostrils expresses
contempt. A skillful observer can
frequently tell if one person admires another.
In this case the eyebrows are raised, disclosing
a brightening eye and a relaxed expression;
sometimes a gentle smile plays about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the mouth. Blushing is merely the physical
expression of certain emotions. We notice
the expression of emotion more in the countenance,
because the effects are there more
plainly visible; but the muscles of the entire
body, the vital organs, and the viscera, are
also vehicles of expression."</p>

<p>These things need but a mention in order
to be recognized and admitted. This is the
<i>action</i> of the Inner upon the Outer. There
is, however, a <i>reaction</i> of the Outer upon the
Inner, which while equally true is not so generally
recognized nor admitted, and we think
it well to briefly call your attention to the
same, for the reason that this correspondence
between the Inner and the Outer&mdash;this <i>reaction</i>
as well as the <i>action</i>&mdash;must be appreciated
in order that the entire meaning and
content of the subject of Human Nature may
be fully grasped.</p>

<p>That the <i>reaction</i> of the Outer Form upon
the Inner State may be understood, we ask
you to consider the following opinions of
well-known and accepted authorities of the
New Psychology, regarding the established
fact that a <i>physical expression related to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
mental state, will, if voluntarily induced,
tend to in turn induce the mental state appropriate
to it</i>. We have used these quotations
in other books of this series, but will
insert them here in this place because they
have a direct bearing upon the particular subject
before us, and because they furnish direct
and unquestioned authority for the
statements just made by us. We ask you to
consider them carefully, for they express a
most important truth.</p>

<p>Prof. Halleck says: "By inducing an expression
we can often cause its allied emotion....
Actors have frequently testified
to the fact that emotion will arise if they
go through the appropriate muscular movements.
In talking to a character on the stage,
if they clench the fist and frown, they often
find themselves becoming really angry; if
they start with counterfeit laughter, they find
themselves growing cheerful. A German
professor says that he cannot walk with a
schoolgirl's mincing step and air without
feeling frivolous."</p>

<p>Prof. Wm. James says: "Whistling to
keep up courage is no mere figure of speech.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
On the other hand, sit all day in a moping
posture, sigh, and reply to everything with
a dismal voice, and your melancholy lingers.
If we wish to conquer undesirable emotional
tendencies in ourselves, we must assiduously,
and in the first instance coldbloodedly, go
through the <i>outward movements</i> of those contrary
dispositions which we wish to cultivate.
Smooth the brow, brighten the eye, contract
the dorsal rather than the ventral aspect of
the frame, and speak in a major key, pass the
genial compliment, and your heart must indeed
be frigid if it does not gradually thaw."</p>

<p>Dr. Wood Hutchinson, says: "To what
extent muscular contractions condition emotions,
as Prof. James has suggested, may be
easily tested by a quaint and simple little experiment
upon a group of the smallest voluntary
muscles of the body, those that move
the eyeball. Choose some time when you are
sitting quietly in your room, free from all
disturbing influences. Then stand up, and
assuming an easy position, cast the eyes upward
and hold them in that position for
thirty seconds. Instantly and involuntarily
you will be conscious of a tendency toward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
reverential, devotional, contemplative ideas
and thoughts. Then turn the eyes sideways,
glancing directly to the right or to the left,
through half-closed lids. Within thirty seconds
images of suspicion, of uneasiness, or of
dislike will rise unbidden to the mind. Turn
the eyes on one side and slightly downward,
and suggestions of jealousy or coquetry will
be apt to spring unbidden. Direct your gaze
downward toward the floor, and you are
likely to go off into a fit of reverie or abstraction."</p>

<p>Prof. Maudsley says: "The specific muscular
action is not merely an exponent of passion,
but truly an essential part of it. If we
try while the features are fixed in the expression
of one passion to call up in the mind a
different one, we shall find it impossible to do
so."</p>

<p>We state the fact of the <i>reaction</i> of the
Outer upon the Inner, with its supporting
quotations from the authorities, not for the
purpose of instructing our readers in the art
of training the emotions by means of the
physical, for while this subject is highly important,
it forms no part of the particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
subject under our present consideration&mdash;but
that the student may realize the close relationship
existing between the Inner State and
the Outer Form. These two elements or
phases, in their constant action and reaction,
manifest the phenomena of Human Nature,
and a knowledge of each, and both give to us
the key which will open for us the door of the
understanding of Human Nature.</p>

<p>Let us now call your attention to an illustration
which embodies both principles&mdash;that
of the Inner and the Outer&mdash;and the action
and reaction between them, as given by that
master of subtle ratiocination, Edgar Allan
Poe. Poe in his story "The Purloined Letter"
tells of a boy at school who attained
great proficiency in the game of "even or
odd" in which one player strives to guess
whether the marbles held in the hand of his
opponent are odd or even. The boy's plan
was to gauge the intelligence of his opponent
regarding the matter of making changes, and
as Poe says: "this lay in mere observation
and admeasurement of the astuteness of his
opponents." Poe describes the process as follows:
"For example, an arrant simpleton is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
his opponent, and, holding up his closed
hand, asks, 'are they even or odd?' Our
schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon
the second trial he wins, for he then says to
himself, 'the simpleton had them even upon
the first trial, and his amount of cunning is
just sufficient to make him have them odd
upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;'&mdash;he
guesses and wins. Now, with a simpleton
a degree above the first, he would have
reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the
first instance I guessed odd, and, in the
second, he will propose to himself upon the
first impulse, a simple variation from even to
odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a
second thought will suggest that this is too
simple a variation, and finally he will decide
upon putting it even as before. I will therefore
guess even;' he guesses even and wins."</p>

<p>Poe continues by stating that this "is
merely an identification of the reasoner's intellect
with that of his opponent. Upon inquiring
of the boy by what means he effected
the <i>thorough</i> identification in which his success
consisted, I received answer as follows:
'When I wish to find out how wise, or how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one,
or what are his thoughts at the moment, <i>I
fashion the expression of my face, as accurately
as possible in accordance with the expression
of his, and then wait to see what
thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or
heart, as if to match or correspond with the
expression</i>.' This response of the school boy
lies at the bottom of all the spurious profundity
which has been attributed to Rochefoucauld,
to La Bougive, to Machiavelli, and
to Campanella."</p>

<p>In this consideration of Human Nature we
shall have much to say about the Outer Form.
But we must ask the reader to always remember
that the Outer Form is always the expression
and manifestation of the Inner State, be
that Inner State latent and dormant within
the depths of the subconscious mentality, or
else active and dynamic in conscious expression.
Just as Prof. James so strongly insists,
we cannot imagine an inner feeling or
emotion without its corresponding outward
physical expression, so is it impossible to
imagine the outward expressions generally
associated with a particular feeling or emo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>tion
without its corresponding inner state.
Whether or not one of these, the outer or inner,
is the <i>cause</i> of the other&mdash;and if so, <i>which
one</i> is the cause and which the effect&mdash;need
not concern us here. In fact, it would seem
more reasonable to accept the theory that
they are correlated and appear simultaneously.
Many careful thinkers have held that
action and reaction are practically the same
thing&mdash;merely the opposite phases of the
same fact. If this be so, then indeed when
we are studying the Outer Form of Human
Nature we are studying psychology just as
much as when we are studying the Inner
States. Prof. Wm. James in his works upon
psychology insists upon the relevancy of the
consideration of the outward expressions of
the inner feeling and emotion, as we have
seen. The same authority speaks even more
emphatically upon this phase of the subject,
as follows:</p>

<p>"The feeling, in the coarser emotions, results
from the bodily expression....
My theory is that the bodily changes follow
directly the perception of the exciting fact,
and that our feeling of the same changes as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
they occur <i>is</i> the emotion.... Particular
perceptions certainly do produce widespread
bodily effects by a sort of immediate
physical influence, antecedent to the arousal
of an emotion or emotional idea....
Every one of the bodily changes, whatsoever
it may be, is <i>felt</i>, acutely or obscurely, the
moment it occurs.... If we fancy some
strong emotion, and then try to abstract
from our consciousness of it all the feelings
of its bodily symptoms, we have nothing left
behind.... A disembodied human emotion
is a sheer nonentity. I do not say that
it is a contradiction in the nature of things,
or that pure spirits are necessarily condemned
to cold intellectual lives; but I say
that for <i>us</i> emotion disassociated from all
bodily feeling is inconceivable. The more
closely I scrutinize my states, the more persuaded
I become that whatever 'coarse' affections
and passions I have are in very truth
constituted by, and made up of, those bodily
changes which we ordinarily call their expression
or consequence.... But our
emotions must always be <i>inwardly</i> what they
are, whatever may be the physiological<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
ground of their apparition. If they are deep,
pure, worthy, spiritual facts on any conceivable
theory of their physiological source,
they remain no less deep, pure, spiritual, and
worthy of regard on this present sensational
theory."</p>

<p>Kay says: "Does the mind or spirit of
man, whatever it may be, in its actings in
and through the body, leave a material impression
or trace in its structure of every
conscious action it performs, which remains
permanently fixed, and forms a material
record of all that it has done in the body, to
which it can afterward refer as to a book and
recall to mind, making it again, as it were,
present to it?... We find nature everywhere
around us recording its movements
and marking the changes it has undergone
in material forms,&mdash;in the crust of the earth,
the composition of the rocks, the structure of
the trees, the conformation of our bodies,
and those spirits of ours, so closely connected
with our material bodies, that so far as we
know, they can think no thought, perform no
action, without their presence and co-operation,
may have been so joined in order to pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>serve
a material and lasting record of all that
they think and do."</p>

<p>Marsh says: "Every human movement,
every organic act, every volition, passion, or
emotion, every intellectual process, is accompanied
with atomic disturbance." Picton
says: "The soul never does one single action
by itself apart from some excitement of bodily
tissue." Emerson says: "The rolling rock
leaves its scratches on the mountain; the
river its channel in the soil; the animal its
bones in the stratum; the fern and leaf their
modest epitaph in the coal. The falling drop
makes its sculpture in the sand or stone....
The ground is all memoranda and
signatures, and every object covered over
with hints which speak to the intelligent. In
nature this self-registration is incessant."
Morell says: "The mind depends for the
manifestation of all its activities upon a material
organism." Bain says: "The organ
of the mind is not the brain by itself; it is the
brain, nerve, muscles, organs of sense, viscera....
It is uncertain how far even
thought, reminiscence, or the emotions of the
past and absent could be sustained without<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
the more distant communication between the
brain and the rest of the body." And, thus,
as we consider the subject carefully we see
that psychology is as much concerned with
the physical manifestations of the mental impulses
and states as with the metaphysical
aspect of those states&mdash;as much with the
Outer Form as with the Inner State&mdash;for it is
practically impossible to permanently separate
them.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the physical accompaniment
or Outer Form, of the psychical
feeling or Inner State, the following quotation
from Darwin's "Origin of the Emotions,"
will well serve the purpose:</p>

<p>"Fear is often preceded by astonishment,
and is so far akin to it that both lead to the
senses of sight and hearing being instantly
aroused. In both cases the eyes and mouth
are widely opened and the eyebrows raised.
The frightened man at first stands like a
statue, motionless and breathless, or crouches
down as if instinctively to escape observation.
The heart beats quickly and violently,
so that it palpitates or knocks against the
ribs; but it is very doubtful if it then works<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
more efficiently than usual, so as to send a
greater supply of blood to all parts of the
body; for the skin instantly becomes pale as
during incipient faintness. This paleness of
the surface, however, is probably in large
part, or is exclusively, due to the vaso-motor
centre being affected in such a manner as to
cause the contraction of the small arteries of
the skin. That the skin is much affected
under the sense of great fear, we see in the
marvelous manner in which perspiration immediately
exudes from it. This exudation is
all the more remarkable, as the surface is
then cold, and hence the term, a cold sweat;
whereas the sudorific glands are properly
excited into action when the surface is heated.
The hairs also on the skin stand erect, and
the superficial muscles shiver. In connection
with the disturbed action of the heart the
breathing is hurried. The salivary glands
act imperfectly; the mouth becomes dry and
is often opened and shut. I have noticed
that under slight fear there is a strong tendency
to yawn. One of the best marked
symptoms is the trembling of all the muscles
of the body; and this is often seen in the lips.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
From this cause, and from the dryness of the
mouth, the voice becomes husky or indistinct
or may altogether fail.... As fear increases
into an agony of terror, we behold,
as under all violent emotions, diversified results.
The heart beats wildly or fails to act
and faintness ensues; there is a death-like
pallor; the breathing is labored; the wings
of the nostrils are widely dilated; there is a
gasping and convulsive motion of the lips; a
tremor of the hollow cheek, a gulping and
catching of the throat; the uncovered and
protruding eyeballs are fixed on the object
of terror; or they may roll restlessly from
side to side. The pupils are said to be enormously
dilated. All the muscles of the body
may become rigid or may be thrown into convulsive
movements. The hands are alternately
clenched and opened, often with a twitching
movement. The arms may be protruded
as if to avert some dreadful danger, or may
be thrown wildly over the head. The Rev.
Mr. Hagenauer has seen this latter action in
a terrified Australian. In other cases there
is a sudden and uncontrolled tendency to
headlong flight; and so strong is this that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
boldest soldiers may be seized with a sudden
panic."</p>

<p>In conclusion, let us say that just as the
above striking description of the master-scientist,
Darwin, shows us that the particular
emotion has its outer manifestations&mdash;the
particular Inner State its Outer Form&mdash;so
has the general <i>character</i> of the person its
outer manifestation, and Outer Form. And,
just as to the eye of the experienced observer
at a distance (even in the case of a photographic
representation, particularly in the
case of a moving picture) may recognize the
Inner State from the Outer Form of the feeling
or emotion, so may the experienced
character reader interpret the whole character
of the person from the Outer Form
thereof. The two interpretations are based
on exactly the same general principles. The
inner thought and feeling manifest in the
outer physical form. He who learns the alphabet
of Outer Form may read page after
page of the book of Human Nature.</p>

<small>THE INNER PHASE: CHARACTER</small></h2>


<p>Do you know what "character" is? The
word itself, in its derivation and original
usage, means: "a stamp, mark or sign, engraved
or stamped." As time passed the
term was applied to the personal peculiarities
of individuals, and was defined as: "the personal
qualities or attributes of a person; the
distinguishing traits of a person." Later the
term was extended to mean: "the part enacted
by anyone in a play." In the common
usage of the term we seek to convey an idea in
which each and all of the above stated meanings
are combined. A man's character is the
result of <i>impressions</i> made upon his own
mind, or those of the race. It is also the
sum of his personal qualities and attributes.
It is also, in a sense, the part he plays in the
great drama of life.</p>

<p>Each man's character has its inner phase
consisting of the accumulated impressions of
the past which seek to manifest in the present.
And, likewise, the character of each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
man manifests in an outer phase of form,
mark, and stamp of <i>personality</i>. There are
no two characters precisely alike. There is
an infinite possibility of combination of the
elements that go to make up character. This
is accordance with what appears to be a universal
law of nature, for there are no two
blades of grass exactly alike, nor two grains
of sand bearing an exact resemblance to each
other. Nature seems to seek after and to
manifest variety of form and quality. But,
still, just as we may classify all things, animate
and inanimate, into general classes and
then into subordinate ones&mdash;each genus and
each species having its particular characteristics,
qualities and attributes, so we may, and
do, classify human character into general
classes and then into particular subdivisions
into which each individual is found to fit.
This fact makes it possible for us to study
Human Nature as a science.</p>

<p>The character of each individual is held to
be the result of the impressions made upon
the plastic material of the mind, either in the
form of past impressions upon his ancestors
or of past impressions received by the indi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>vidual.
The past impressions reach him
through the channel of heredity, while the
personal impressions come to him through
environment. But by heredity we do not
mean the transmission of the personal characteristics
of one's parents or even grand-parents,
but something far deeper and
broader. We believe that one inherits far
less of the qualities of one's parents than is
generally believed. But, we believe that
much that goes to make up our character is
derived from the associated qualities and impressions
of many generations of ancestors.
Inasmuch as each individual contains within
him the transmitted qualities of nearly every
individual who lived several thousand years
ago, it may be said that each individual is
an heir to the accumulated impressions of the
race, which however form in an infinite
variety of combinations, the result being that
although the root of the race is the same yet
each individual differs in combination from
each other individual. As Luther Burbank
has said: "Heredity means much, but what
is heredity? Not some hideous ancestral
specter, forever crossing the path of a human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
being. Heredity is simply the sum of all the
effects of all the environments of all past generations
on the responsive ever-moving life-forces."</p>

<p>The records of the past environment of
the race are stored away in the great region
of the subconscious mentality, from whence
they arise in response to the call of some attractive
object of thought or perception, always,
however, modified and restrained by
the opposite characteristics. As Prof. Elmer
Gates has said: "At least ninety per cent of
our mental life is sub-conscious. If you will
analyze your mental operations you will find
that conscious thinking is never a continuous
line of consciousness, but a series of conscious
data with great intervals of subconsciousness.
We sit and try to solve a problem
and fail. We walk around, try again and
fail. Suddenly an idea dawns that leads to
a solution of the problem. The sub-conscious
processes were at work. We do not volitionally
create our own thinking. It takes place
in us. We are more or less passive recipients.
We cannot change the nature of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
thought, or of a truth, but we can, as it were,
guide the ship by a moving of the helm."</p>

<p>But character is dependent upon race inheritance
only for its raw materials, which
are then worked into shape by the influence
of environment and by the will of the individual.
A man's environment is, to some extent
at least, dependent upon the will. A man
may change his environment, and by the use
of his will he may overcome many inherited
tendencies. As Halleck well says: "Heredity
is a powerful factor, for it supplies raw
material for the will to shape. Even the will
cannot make anything without material. Will
acts through choice, and some kinds of environment
afford far more opportunities for
choice than others. Shakespeare found in
London the germ of true theatrical taste, already
vivified by a long line of miracle plays,
moralities and interludes. In youth he connected
himself with the theatre, and his will
responded powerfully to his environment.
Some surroundings are rich in suggestion,
affording opportunity for choice, while others
are poor. The will is absolutely confined to
a choice between alternatives. <i>Character<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
then, is a resultant of will power, heredity
and environment.</i> The modern tendency is
to overestimate the effects of heredity and
environment in forming character; but, on
the other hand, we must not underestimate
them. The child of a Hottentot put in
Shakespeare's home, and afterward sent
away to London with him, would never have
made a Shakespeare; for heredity would not
have given the will sufficient raw material
to fashion over into such a noble product.
We may also suppose a case to show the great
power of environment. Had a band of gypsies
stolen Shakespeare at birth, carried him
to Tartary, and left him among the nomads,
his environment would never have allowed
him to produce such plays as he placed upon
the English stage."</p>

<p>Many persons are reluctant to admit the
effect of heredity upon character. They seem
to regard heredity as the idea of a monster
ruling the individual with an iron hand, and
with an emphasis upon undesirable traits of
character. Such people lose sight of the fact
that at the best heredity merely supplies us
with the raw material of character rather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
than the finished product, and that <i>there is
much good in this raw material</i>. We receive
our inheritance of good as well as bad. Deprive
a man of the advantage of his heredity,
and we place him back to the plane of the
savage, or perhaps still lower in the scale.
Heredity is simply the shoulders of the race
affording us a place for our feet, in order
that we may rise higher than those who lived
before. For <i>heredity</i>, substitute <i>evolution</i>,
and we may get a clearer idea of this element
of character.</p>

<p>As for environment, it is folly to deny its
influence. Take two young persons of equal
ability, similar tastes, and the same heredity,
and place them one in a small village, and
the other in a great metropolis, and keep
them there until middle-age, and we will see
the influence of environment. The two may
be equally happy and contented, and may
possess the same degree of book-education,
but, nevertheless, their experiences will have
been so different that the character of the two
individuals must be different. In the same
way, place the two young persons, one in the
Whitechapel district, and the other amidst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the best surroundings and example, and see
the result. Remember, that in <i>environment</i>
is included the influence of other persons.
The effect of environment arises from Suggestion,
that great moulding and creative
principle of the mind. It is true that, "As a
man thinketh, so is he," but a man's thoughts
depend materially upon the <i>associations</i> of
environment, experience, and suggestion.
As Ziehen says: "We cannot think as we will,
but we must think as just those associations
which happen to be present prescribe."</p>

<p>But, without going further into the question
of the elements which go toward forming
character, let us take our position firmly
upon the fact that each individual is stamped
with the impression of a special character&mdash;a
<i>character</i> all his own. Each has his own
character or part to play in the great drama
of life. The character of some seems fixed
and unchangeable, while that of others is seen
to be in the process of change. But in either
case each and every man has his own character
or manifestation of Human Nature, in
its inner and outer aspects. And each individual,
while in a sense forming a special
class by himself, nevertheless belongs to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
larger class, which in turn is a part of a still
larger, and so on.</p>

<p>Instead of studying the philosophy or
metaphysics of character, or even its general
psychology, let us in this particular volume
devote our attention to the elements which
go to form the character of each and every
person, so that we may understand them
when we meet them in manifested form.
And let us learn the Outer Form which accompany
these Inner States.</p>

<p>Upon the stage of Life move backward
and forward many characters, each having
his or her own form, manner and appearance,
which like those of the characters upon the
mimic stage, may be recognized if we will
but bestow a little care upon the subject. The
Othellos, Hamlets, Shylocks, Iagos, Richards,
Lears, and the rest are to be found in everyday
life. The Micawbers, Chuzzlewits,
Twists, and the rest are in as full evidence
on the streets and in the offices, as in the
books. The person who is able to read and
interpret Human Nature is possessed of a
knowledge far more useful to him than that
contained within the covers of musty books
upon impractical subjects.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE OUTER PHASE: PERSONALITY</small></h2>


<p>Just as <i>character</i> is the inner phase of
Human Nature, so is <i>personality</i> its outer
phase. To many the two terms are synonymous,
but analysis will show the shades of
difference between them. A man's <i>character</i>
is his inner self, while his <i>personality</i> is the
outward indication of his self. The word, in
this sense, is defined as: "That which constitutes
the personal traits of a person, as
his manner, conduct, habits, appearance, and
other observable personal peculiarities."</p>

<p>The word is derived from the Latin word,
<i>persona</i>, meaning, "a mask used by play-actors,"
which in turn was derived from the
two words <i>per</i>, meaning "through," and
<i>sono</i>, meaning, "to sound," or combined, "to
sound through." And the derivation of the
term really gives us an idea of its inner
meaning, for the personality is really the
mask worn by the character, and <i>through
which it sounds</i>, speaks, or manifests itself,
Jeremy Taylor once said: "No man can long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
put on <i>person</i> and act a part but his evil manners
will peep through the corners of his
white robe." Archbishop Trench once said
that the real meaning of the phrase, "God is
no respecter of <i>persons</i>" is that the Almighty
cared nothing for what <i>part</i> in life a person
plays, but <i>how</i> he plays it. The old-time
play-actor was wont to assume a mask of the
features of the part he played, just as the
modern actor "makes up" for the part and
walks, speaks and acts in accordance therewith.
Whether or not the individual be
aware of the fact, Nature furnishes to each
his mask of personality&mdash;his <i>persona</i>&mdash;by
which those who understand may recognize
the part he plays, or his character. In both
the inner <i>character</i>, and the outer <i>personality</i>,
each individual struts the stage of life
and plays his part.</p>

<p>The mask or "make up," of personality,
by which men may read each other's character,
is evolved and developed from the instinctive
physical expression accompanying
thought, feeling and emotion. Just as the
frown accompanying the feeling of annoyance
or anger will, if repeated sufficiently<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
often, become fixed upon the countenance of
the man, so will all of his general thoughts,
feelings and emotions register themselves in
his manner, gait, tone of voice, carriage and
facial expression. Moreover, his inherited
tendencies will show themselves in the same
way.</p>

<p>Professor Wm. James says, regarding the
genesis of emotional reactions: "How come
the various objects which excite emotion to
produce such special and different bodily effects?
This question was not asked till quite
recently, but already some interesting suggestions
toward answering it have been
made. Some movements of expression can
be accounted for as weakened repetitions of
movements which formerly (when they were
stronger) were of utility to the subject.
Others are similarly weakened repetitions of
movements which under other conditions were
physiologically necessary concomitants of the
useful movements. Of the latter reactions, the
respiratory disturbances in anger and fear
might be taken as examples&mdash;organic reminiscences,
as it were, reverberations in imagination
of the blowings of the man making a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
series of combative efforts, or the pantings
of one in precipitate flight. Such at least is
a suggestion made by Mr. Spencer which has
found approval."</p>

<p>Herbert Spencer says, on this subject:
"To have in a slight degree such psychical
states as accompany the reception of wounds,
and are experienced during flight, is to be in
a state of what we call fear. And to have in
a slight degree such psychical states as the
processes of catching, killing, and eating imply,
is to have the desires to catch, kill and
eat. That the propensities to the acts are
nothing else than nascent excitations of the
psychical state involved in the acts, is proved
by the natural language of the propensities.
Fear, when strong, expresses itself in cries, in
efforts to escape in palpitations, in tremblings;
and these are just the manifestations
that go along with an actual suffering of the
evil feared. The destructive passion is shown
in a general tension of the muscular system,
in gnashing of teeth and protrusion of the
claws, in dilated eyes and nostrils in growls;
and these are weaker forms of the actions
that accompany the killing of prey. To such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
objective evidences every one can add subjective
evidences. Everyone can testify that
the psychical state called fear consists of
mental representations of certain painful results;
and that the one called anger consists
of mental representations of the actions and
impressions which would occur while inflicting
some kind of pain."</p>

<p>Professor Wm. James adds the following
to the discussion: "So slight a symptom as
the snarl or sneer, the one-sided uncovering
of the upper teeth, is accounted for by Darwin
as a survival from the time when our
ancestors had large canines, and unfleshed
him (as dogs do now) for attack. Similarly
the raising of the eyebrows in outward attention,
the opening of the mouth in astonishment,
come, according to the same author,
from the utility of these movements in extreme
cases. The raising of the eyebrows
goes with the opening of the eye for better
vision, the opening of the mouth with the intensest
listening, and with the rapid catching
of the breath which precedes muscular
effort. The distension of the nostrils in
anger is interpreted by Spencer as an echo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of the way in which our ancestors had to
breathe when, during combat, their 'mouth
was filled up by a part of an antagonist's
body that had been seized.' The trembling
of fear is supposed by Mantegazza to be for
the sake of warming the blood. The reddening
of the face and neck is called by Wundt
a compensatory arrangement for relieving
the brain of the blood-pressure which the
simultaneous excitement of the heart brings
with it. The effusion of tears is explained
both by this author and by Darwin to be a
blood-withdrawing agency of a similar sort.
The contraction of the muscles around the
eyes, of which the primitive use is to protect
those organs from being too much gorged
with blood during the screaming fits of infancy,
survives in adult life in the shape of
the frown, which instantly comes over the
brow when anything difficult or displeasing
presents itself either to thought or action."</p>

<p>Thus, it will be seen, the fact that all inward
states manifest themselves to some degree
in outward physical expression, brings
with it the logical inference that particular
mental states when habitually manifested<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
tend to fix in the physical organism the expression
associated with them. As "thoughts
take form in action," so habitual mental
states tend to register traces of those actions.
A piece of paper folded in a certain way several
times shows plainly the marks on the folding.
In the same manner the creases in our
clothing, shoes and gloves, show the marks
of our personal physical form. A habitual
mental state of cheerfulness is accompanied
by a frequent exercise of the muscles expressing
the physical signs of that feeling, and
finally the smile wrinkles are formed that all
may read them. In the same way the gloomy,
pessimistic mental attitude produces the
marks and wrinkles showing the habit of frequent
down-turning of the corners of our
mouths. A habitual mental attitude of suspicion
will tend to impart the appearance of
the "suspicious peering" to our eyes. The
mental attitude of combativeness will likewise
give us the traditional set jaw and
tightly compressed lips. The mental attitude
of lack of self-respect will show itself in
our walk, and so, in the opposite manner with
the mental attitude of self-respect. People<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
grow to walk, talk, carry themselves, and
"look like" their habitual mental attitude.</p>

<p>Dr. A. T. Schofield, says: "'He is a dull
scholar,' it is said, 'who cannot read a man's
character even from a back view.' Round a
statue of the prince Consort in Edinburgh
stand representative groups paying homage
to him. If you get a back view of any of
these you can see unconscious mind impressed
on matter, and can tell at once the sailor or
soldier, peasant or scholar or workman.
Look at the body and face of a man when
the mind is gone. Look at the body of a man
who has lost his self-respect. Look at the
body of a thief, of a sot, of a miser. Compare
the faces and expressions of a philanthropist,
of a beggar, of a policeman, of a scholar, of
a sailor, of a lawyer, of a doctor, of a shop-walker,
of a sandwich man, of a farmer, of
a successful manufacturer, of a nurse, of a
refined girl, of a servant, of a barmaid, of a
nun, of a ballet dancer, of an art student,
and answer to yourself these two questions:
First, are these different expressions of body
and face due essentially to <i>physical</i> or
<i>psychical</i> causes? And, secondly, do these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
psychical causes act on the facial and other
muscles in consciousness or out of consciousness.
The only possible answers to these two
questions leave us with this fact, were no
other proof possible, that we each have
within us an unconscious <i>psychical</i> power
(here called the unconscious mind) which has
sufficient force to act upon the body and display
psychical conceptions through physical
media."</p>

<p>It is impossible for us (at least by any of
the five senses) to peer into the mental chamber
of other men and there read the record
of their <i>character</i>, or to interpret the combination
of Human Nature therein moulded
and formed. But nevertheless we are not
balked in our desire, for by learning to interpret
the outward signs of personality we may
arrive with a wonderful degree of success at
an understanding of the character, mind, or
Human Nature in others. From the seen
Outer we may deduce the unseen Inner. We
may discern the shape of that which is concealed,
by observing the form of the covering
which hides it from sight. The body, like the
fabled veil of the goddess, "conceals but to
reveal."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>THE TEMPERAMENTS</small></h2>


<p>The student of Human Nature soon discovers
that among men, as among the animals,
there is to be observed a great variety of
"quality," and various classes of "temperament."
Among cattle we notice great differences
of form which differences indicate certain
qualities inherent in the beast. Certain
qualities are recognized by their outward
forms as being indicative of sturdiness, staying-qualities,
strong vitality, etc., which render
their possessor valuable for draught
oxen. Other qualities indicate the value of
another animal for meat producing. Others,
the production of large quantities of milk.
Others, prolific breeding. And, so on, each
set of qualities being recognized by its outward
form and being taken into consideration
by breeders. In the same way, breeders
recognize certain qualities in horses which
they take advantage of in breeding for the
strength of draught horses; the speed of
thoroughbred runners and trotters; the docil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>ity
and gentleness of driving horses and
saddle animals. The draught horse and the
thoroughbred runner or trotter may be easily
distinguished by the eye of the average person,
while it requires the eye of the expert
to distinguish other points and signs of quality
which prove the existence of certain traits
of temperament in the animal. The same is
true in the case of chickens and other fowls.
Some types are adapted for laying, others for
meat purposes, others for gameness, etc.
Not only the physical qualities but also the
temperamental traits of the beast or bird are
distinguished by the expert, and are taken
advantage of in breeding to develop and
evolve the indicated trait or quality.</p>

<p>Nearly anyone may distinguish the temperamental
difference between the savage
dog and the affectionate one&mdash;between the
vicious horse and the docile one. We know
at once that certain dogs may be approached
and others kept at a distance&mdash;that certain
horses are safe to ride or drive, and that
others are unsafe and dangerous. A visit to
a horse and cattle show, or a poultry and
pigeon exhibition, will show even the most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
skeptical person that Inner States manifest
in Outer Form. And a little further study
and observation will show that what is true
of these lower animals is likewise true of the
human being. Men, like animals, may be intelligently
and scientifically classified according
to the general "quality" or "temperament."
While each individual is different in
a way from every other individual, nevertheless,
each individual belongs to a certain class
and may be labelled accordingly. A few outward
signs will indicate his class, and we
may confidently expect that he will manifest
the leading qualities of that particular class.</p>


<h4>QUALITY</h4>

<p>The first classification of the individuals
of the human race is that of <i>Quality</i>. Independent
of the various temperaments, although
in a way related to them, we find the
various degrees of Quality manifested by different
individuals. "Quality" may be defined
as the "degree of <i>fineness</i>." It is that
which we call "class" in race-horses;
"breed" in other animals and often "blood"
in men and women. Perhaps one may under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>stand
the classification better if he will recall
the differences apparent between the mongrel
cur and the highbred dog; the "scrub" horse
and the thoroughbred; the common cow and
the carefully bred Alderney or other choice
variety; the ordinary barnyard fowl and the
prize-winner at the poultry show. It is an
intangible but real and readily recognized
difference, which however is almost impossible
to convey by words.</p>

<p>Men and women of the highest <i>Quality</i> are
essentially fine-grained, possessed of fine
feelings, refined natures, high tastes, and
manifest the signs of <i>true natural</i> refinement
and culture, which cannot be successfully
imitated by those who have acquired
merely the artificial manner and the outward
polish. One may possess Quality in a high
degree and still be ignorant of the forms and
little manners of so-called "polite society,"
and yet will be recognized as one of "Nature's
noblemen," and as a "natural gentleman."</p>

<p>Descending the scale we find lessening degrees
of the manifestation of Quality, until,
finally we reach the lowest degree of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
scale, that of <i>low</i> Quality. In this lowest degree
we find individuals showing all the outward
signs of being coarse-grained, vulgar,
of low tastes, brutal instincts, and manifesting
the signs of lack of refinement and culture.
Persons of low Quality are found in
all walks of life. Some of those possessing
wealth and education belong to this class,
and are never able to counterfeit the reality.
Quality is a matter of "soul," and not of
wealth, education or material advantages. A
greyhound and a hyena give us animal symbols
of Quality, high and low.</p>

<p>We meet many instances in which the individual
is of too high Quality for his environment,
occupation or place in life. Such individuals
suffer keenly and are to be pitied.
They incline toward high ideals and are
wounded and discouraged by the grossness
which they see on all sides. Those individuals
of an average degree of Quality of
course fit into the usual environment far
better than those above or below them in the
scale. We also meet individuals of low
Quality in surroundings in which they are
out of place&mdash;we see many instances of "pigs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
in the parlor." These individuals, however,
find it much easier to descend to their own
level, than it is for the high Quality individuals
to ascend to theirs. The coarse man
finds but little trouble in meeting with boon
companions whose tastes are harmonious to
his. The person of extremely high Quality
may be said to have been born before his
time, while those of the lowest Quality are
atavistic and born after their time. Remember,
always, that Quality is an attribute of
"soul," and not of birth, wealth, or even of
education. We may find many "gentlemen"
of humble birth, small means and limited
education; and also many "educated pigs"
of high lineage and full coffers.</p>

<p>The Outer Form of Quality is shown by
the relative <i>fineness</i> of general structure,
and by the general form, appearance, manner,
motion, voice, laughter, and more than
all by that indescribable impression of "fineness"
and "distinction" which they produce
upon observing persons with whom they come
in contact.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that Quality is a
very different thing from intellectuality or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
morality. A high Quality person may be immoral
and not specially intellectual, although
there is almost always a <i>keenness</i> of perception,
and almost intuitive recognition, in these
cases&mdash;the immorality is generally lacking in
coarseness, and is usually connected with
perversion of the &aelig;sthetic faculties. In the
same way, the person of low Quality often
may be moral according to the code, but will
be coarse in the manifestation of that virtue,
and may possess a certain low cunning which
with many persons passes for intellect and
"brains." In speaking of Quality, the words
"fineness" and "coarseness" come easily to
the mind and tongue and are perhaps the
terms most suggestive of the two extremes of
this attribute of the Man.</p>


<h4>TEMPERAMENT</h4>

<p>Next in the order of consideration we find
what is called <i>Temperament</i>. Temperament
is defined as: "That individual peculiarity

of the mind, especially as regards the
passions and affections."</p>

<p>Hippocrates, the ancient Greek philosopher-physician
(B. C. 468-367) held to the
existence of four temperaments, which he attributed
to certain qualities of the blood and
the several secretions of the body such as the
bile, etc. While his theory was rejected by
later investigators, his classification continued
until very recently under the name of
(1) the Sanguine; (2) the Lymphatic or
Phlegmatic; (3) the Choleric or Bilious; and
(4) the Melancholic temperaments, respectively.
As a matter of general information
on the subject we herewith give the old classification
with the attributes of each class:</p>

<p>The <i>Sanguine</i> temperament was held to be
characterized by red or light-brown hair,
blue eyes, a fair or ruddy complexion, large
arteries and veins, a full and rapid pulse,
slight perspiration, impatience of heat, febrile
tendency, and lively and cheerful temper, excitable
passions, a warm, ardent, impulsive
disposition, and a liking for active pursuits;</p>

<p>The <i>Lymphatic</i>, or <i>Phlegmatic</i> temperament
was held to be characterized by light,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
sandy, or whitish hair, light grey eyes, pallid
complexion, skin almost devoid of hair, flabby
tissues, much perspiration, small blood-vessels,
a feeble and slow pulse, want of energy,
lack of activity, deficient spirit and vividness;</p>

<p>The <i>Choleric</i> or <i>Bilious</i> temperament was
held to be characterized by black hair often
curling, black or hazel eyes, and dark but
ruddy complexion, hairy skin, strong full
pulse, firm muscles, great activity and positiveness,
strength of character, and an active
brain.</p>

<p>The <i>Melancholic</i> temperament was held to
be characterized by black hair, black or hazel
eyes, a dark leaden complexion, pulse slow
and feeble, and a disposition toward study,
poetry, literature, and sentiment.</p>

<p>Some later authorities added a fifth temperament,
called the <i>Nervous</i> temperament,
which was held to be characterized by a
medium complexion, large brain, small physical
frame, fineness of organization, thin hair,
finely cut features, quick lively disposition,
intellectual tastes and tendencies, sensitive
nature, high capacity for enjoyment and
suffering.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>The latest authorities, however, discarded
the old classification and adopted one more
simple although fully as comprehensive. The
new classification recognizes <i>three</i> classes of
temperament, viz: (1) the Vital; (2) the Motive;
and (3) the Mental, the characteristics
of which are held to be as follows:</p>

<p>The <i>Vital</i> temperament has its basis in the
predominance of the nutritive system, including
the blood-vessels, lymphatics and the
glands. Its organs are the heart, lungs,
stomach, liver, bowels, and the entire internal
vital system. It is characterized by a large,
broad frame; broad shoulders; deep chest;
full round abdomen; round plump limbs;
short thick neck; comparatively small hands
and feet; full face; flushed and florid cheeks;
and general "well fed" appearance. Those
in whom it is predominant are fond of out-of-door
exercise, although not of hard work;
crave the "good things of life;" fond of
sport, games and play; love variety of entertainment
and amusement; are affectionate;
love praise and flattery; prefer concrete
rather than abstract subjects of thought; look
out for themselves; are selfish, but yet "good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
fellows" when it does not cost too much physical
discomfort to themselves; usually enjoy
good health, yet when ill are apt to be very
weak; tend to feverishness and apoplexy, etc.</p>

<p>Persons of the Vital temperament may
have either fair or dark complexion, but in
either case the cheeks and face are apt to be
ruddy and flushed. Those of the dark type
are apt to have greater power of endurance,
while those of the light type are apt to be
more sprightly and active. This temperament
is particularly noticeable in women, a
large proportion of whom belong to its class.
This temperament furnishes the majority of
the good companions, sociable friends and
acquaintances, and theatre goers. A leading
phrenologist says of them that they "incline
to become agents, overseers, captains, hotel-keepers,
butchers, traders, speculators, politicians,
public officers, aldermen, contractors,
etc., rather than anything requiring steady or
hard work." We have noticed that a large
number of railroad engineers and policemen
are of this temperament.</p>

<p>The <i>Motive</i> temperament has as its basis
the predominance of the motive or mechan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>ical
system, including the muscles, bones and
ligaments&mdash;the general system of active work
and motion. Its organs are those of the entire
framework of the body, together with
those muscles and ligaments, large and small,
general and special, which enable man to
walk, move, and work. It is characterized by
strong constitution, physical power, strong
character, active feeling, and tendency toward
work; large bones and joints; hard muscles;
angular and rugged figure; usually broad
shoulders and deep chest; comparatively
small and flat abdomen; oblong face; large
jaw; high cheek-bones; strong large teeth;
bushy coarse hair; rugged features and
prominent nose, ears, mouth, etc. Those in
whom it is predominant are fond of physical
and mental work; are tenacious and try to
carry through what they undertake; resist
fatigue; are "good stayers;" are full of
dogged persistence and resistance; and are
apt to manifest creative effort and work.</p>

<p>Persons of the Motive temperament may
have either dark or light complexion. The
Scotch or Scandanavian people show this
temperament strongly, as also do a certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
type of Americans. The world's active
workers come chiefly from this class. This
temperament is far more common among
men than among women. The fighting nations
who have in different times swept over
other countries display this temperament
strongly. This temperament, predominant,
although associated with the other temperaments
has distinguished the "men who do
things" in the world's history. It's "raw-bone"
and gawkiness has swept things before
it, and has built up great things in all
times. Its individuals have a burning desire
to "take hold and pull," or to "get together
and start something." As the name implies,
this temperament is the "moving force" in
mankind.</p>

<p>The <i>Mental</i> temperament has its basis in
the predominance of the nervous system, including
the brain and spinal cord. Its organs
are the brain, or brains; the spinal cord
with its connecting nerves&mdash;in fact the entire
nervous system, including the "sympathetic"
nervous system, the various <i>plexi</i>, and the
nervous substance found in various parts of
the body. It is characterized by a light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
build; slight frame; comparatively large
head; quick movements; sharp features; thin
sharp nose; thin lips; sharp and not very
strong teeth; keen, penetrating eye; high
forehead and upper head; fondness for brain
work; disinclination for physical drudgery;
sensitive nature; quick perception; rapid
mental action; developed intuition; fine and
shapely features; expressive countenance,
expressive and striking voice, generally
rather "high-strung," vividness and intensity
of emotion and feeling, etc.</p>

<p>Persons of this temperament are apt to
be more or less "intense;" enjoy and suffer
keenly; are sensitive to reproach or criticism;
are inclined to be sedentary; take a pleasure
in "thinking," and often burn their candle of
life at both ends, because of this tendency;
and incline to occupations in which their
brains rather than their body is exercised.
They may be either of dark or of light complexion,
and in either case are apt to have
bright, expressive eyes. The impression
created by an examination of their physical
characteristics is that of <i>sharpness</i>. The
fox, weasel, greyhound, and similar animals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
illustrate this type. Persons of this temperament
are apt to be either <i>very</i> good or
<i>very</i> bad. They run to extremes, and sometimes
execute a quick "right about face."
When properly balanced, this temperament
produces the world's greatest thinkers along
all lines of thought. When not properly balanced
it produces the abnormally gifted
"genius," between whom and the unbalanced
person there is but a slender line of division;
or the eccentric person with his so-called
"artistic temperament," the "crank" with
his hobbies and vagaries, and the brilliant
degenerate who dazzles yet horrifies the
world.</p>


<h4>BALANCED TEMPERAMENTS</h4>

<p>The best authorities agree in the belief
that the Balanced Temperament is the most
desirable. That is, the condition in which the
three temperaments balance each other perfectly,
so that the weak points of each are
remedied by the strong points of the others,
and the extremes of each are neutralized and
held in check by the influence of the others.
Prof. O. S. Fowler, the veteran phrenologist<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
says upon this point: "A well balanced organism,
with all the temperaments large and
in about equal proportion, is by far the best
and most favorable for both enjoyment and
efficiency; to general genius and real greatness;
to strength along with perfection of
character; to consistency and power throughout.
The Motive large, with the Mental deficient,
gives power with sluggishness, so that
the powers lie dormant; adding large Vital
gives great physical power and enjoyment,
with too little of the Mental and the moral,
along with coarseness; while the Mental in
excess creates too much mind for body, too
much exquisiteness and sentimentality for the
stamina, along with a green-house precocity
most destructive of life's powers and pleasures;
whereas their equal balance gives abundance
of vital force, physical stamina, and
mental power and susceptibility. They may
be compared to the several parts of a steamboat
and its appurtenances. The Vital is
the steam-power; the Motive, the hulk or
framework; the Mental, the freight or passengers.
Predominant Vital generates more
vital energy than can well be worked off,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
which causes restlessness, excessive passion,
and a pressure which endangers outbursts
and overt actions; predominant Motive gives
too much frame or hulk, moves slowly, and
with weak Mental, is too light-freighted to
secure the great ends of life, predominant
Mental overloads, and endangers sinking;
but all equally balanced and powerful, carry
great loads rapidly and well, and accomplish
wonders. Such persons unite cool judgments
with intense and well-governed feelings;
great force of character and intellect with
perfect consistency; scholarship with sound
common sense; far seeing sagacity with brilliancy;
and have the highest order of both
physiology and mentality."</p>

<p>Professor Nelson Sizer, another high authority
said: "In nature the temperaments
exist in combination, one being, however, the
most conspicuous. So rarely do we find examples
of an even mixture or balance, that it
may be said that they who possess it are
marvellous exceptions in the current of human
society. Such an even mixture would
indicate a most extraordinary heritage; it
would be constitutional perfection. But,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
once in a while, a person is met in whom there
is a close approach to this balance, and we
are accustomed to speak of it as a <i>balanced</i>
temperament, it being difficult to determine
which element is in predominance."</p>


<h4>MIXED TEMPERAMENTS</h4>

<p>The experience of the older phrenologists,
which is verified by the investigations of the
later authorities, was that in the majority of
persons <i>two</i> of the temperaments are well
developed, the third remaining comparatively
undeveloped. Of the two active temperaments,
<i>one</i> is usually found to be predominant,
although in many the two are found to
be almost equally developed. But even in
the last mentioned instance one of the two
seems to have been more actively called forth
by the environment of the person, and may
therefore be regarded as the ruling temperament.
Arising from this fact we find the several
classes of Mixed Temperament, known,
respectively, as: the Vital-Motive; the Motive-Vital;
the Motive-Mental; the Mental-Motive;
the Vital-Mental; and the Mental-Vital.
In these classes the name of the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>dominant,
or most active temperament appears
first, the second name indicating the
temperament relatively undeveloped or inactive.</p>

<p>The <i>Vital-Motive</i> and the <i>Motive-Vital</i>
temperaments give the combination in which
is manifested physical activity and strong
vitality. Those of these temperaments are
adapted to out-of-door work, such as farming,
out-of-door trades, mechanics, soldiers and
sailors, and other occupations requiring
strong vital power and muscular strength
and activity. The physical characteristics
are the prominent bones and strong muscles
of the Motive, and well-rounded limbs and
"stout" forms of the Vital. When the Vital
predominates, there is apt to be more flesh;
when the Motive predominates there is apt
to be more ruggedness and muscular development.</p>

<p>The <i>Motive-Mental</i> and <i>Mental-Motive</i>
temperaments give the combination in which
is manifested the physical activity of the Motive
and the mental activity of the Motive
and the mental activity of the Mental&mdash;the
physical and mental characteristics of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
Vital being absent. The Mental element relieves
the Motive of some of its crudeness
and roughness, while the Motive relieves the
Mental of its tendency to get away from the
practical side of things. The strong frame
and muscles are balanced by the brain-development.
Those of this temperament make
good practical business men, physicians,
lawyers, scientists, explorers, and others who
have to work and think at the same time.
These people often manifest great executive
ability. When the Motive predominates, the
tendency is toward out-of-door occupations
in which the brain is used in connection with
bodily activity. When the Mental predominates
there is a tendency toward in-door occupations
in which active brain work is required.
These people have well-developed
heads, together with wiry, strong bodies.
Some of the most successful men have come
from this class.</p>

<p>The <i>Vital-Mental</i> and <i>Mental-Vital</i> temperaments
give the combination in which is
manifested many attractive traits which render
their possessor agreeable, companionable,
and at the same time bright and intel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>ligent.
The Vital element gives a plumpness
to the form, while the Mental imparts a
brightness to the mind. This is the temperament
of many attractive women. The Mental
activity tends to counterbalance the Vital
tendency toward physical ease and comfort.
These people make good orators, after dinner
speakers, and agreeable society men and
women, actors, artists, poets, and popular
literary men. The respective predominance
of the Mental or the Vital, in this combination,
gives to this class somewhat of a variety,
but a little observation will soon enable one
to recognize the individuals belonging to it.
A certain combination in this class produces
the trait of "emotionality," or superficial
feeling and sympathy.</p>

<p>The student of Human Nature should pay
much attention to Temperament and the outward
indications of each class and sub-class,
for Temperament gives us much of our best
information regarding character and disposition,
in fact Character Reading depends materially
upon the interpretation of Temperament.</p>

<small>THE MENTAL QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>We now approach the subject of the several
particular mental qualities, and the groups
thereof, both in the phase of their inner states
and that of their outer form. In the consideration
of both of these phases we must avail
ourselves of the investigations and researches
of the old phrenologists who cleared a path
for all who follow. Although many of the
phrenological theories are rejected by modern
psychologists and biologists, nevertheless
their work established a firm foundation
for the science of the study of the brain and
its functions. And to Gall and his followers
we are indebted for the discovery and teaching
that the activity and development of the
several mental qualities or faculties manifest
in outer form in the shape of the skull.</p>

THE MENTAL QUALITIES" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span><br />

THE MENTAL QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p>The general principles of phrenology may
be briefly stated as follows:</p>

<p>I. The Brain is the organ of the mind.</p>

<p>II. The mind is not a single entity or
power, but has several faculties, stronger or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
weaker, which determine the character of
the individual.</p>

<p>III. That each faculty or propensity has
a special organ in the brain.</p>

<p>IV. The size of the brain (the quality
being equal) is the true measure of power.</p>

<p>V. There are several groups of faculties,
and each group is represented by organs located
in the same region of the brain.</p>

<p>VI. The relative size of each organ results
from the activity of its appropriate faculty.</p>

<p>VII. The size of the organ is indicated by
the appearance and size of the skull immediately
over the region of the organ.</p>

<p>VIII. The Quality and Temperament of
the organization determine the degree of
vigor, activity, and endurance of the mental
powers.</p>

<p>Modern psychology and biology claim to
have disproven many of the phrenological
contentions, while other lines of investigation
have given us other theories to account
for the phenomena first noted by the phrenologists.
Some investigators of brain development
and action hold that while certain
mental states manifest in outer form on por<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>tions
of the skull, the phenomenon is due to
the action of the <i>cranial muscles</i> rather than
to the fact of the localization of special faculties&mdash;that
each mental state is associated
with certain actions on the part of certain
cranial muscles which in turn exert a modifying
effect upon the shape and size of the
skull.</p>

<p>As Erbes states it "the effect the scheme of
cranial muscles have had and still have upon
the conformation of the skull, and, consequently,
had in determining the location of
those areas and in giving brain and mind a
character approximately identical from end
to end of the scale of living things possessing
the cerebro-spinal nervous system. In so far
as the neural matter is dependent upon the
cranial muscles&mdash;aside from the sensory
stimuli&mdash;so far, likewise are the psychic
manifestations, through tongue or limb, modified
by variations in those muscles that, after
their creative task is done, assume a vasomotor
control over their respective areas."
The same writer also says: "The cerebral
mass owes its location and subsequent expansion,
moreover, in a measure that mind owes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
its character, primarily to the action of the
muscles attached to and lying upon its
peripheral covering, the skull; these same
muscles thereafter, through exercising a cerebral
vasomotor control, act in the nature of
keys for calling the evolved dependent brain
areas into play, singly and en masse."</p>

<p>Others have held that the development of
certain areas of the surface of the skull is
due to peculiar neural or nervous, activities
having their seat in certain parts of the brain
adjacent to their appropriate area of the
skull, but these theories fail to explain the
nature of the relation between the mind,
brain and the "nerve centres" aforesaid.</p>

<p>These several authorities, and others, however,
agree upon the fact that certain areas
of the brain are associated in some way with
certain mental states; and that these brain
areas register their relative activity upon the
areas of the skull adjacent thereto; and that
the <i>activity</i> and <i>power</i> of each brain area, or
faculty, is denoted by the <i>size</i> of the associated
skull-area. Thus, the outward facts
claimed by phrenology are admitted, while
their theories of cause are disputed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>In this book we shall rest content with these
"outward facts" of phrenology, and shall not
concern ourselves with the various theories
which seek to explain them, preferring to
leave that task for others. In considering the
subject of the Outer Form associated with
the Inner State of Human Nature, we shall
merely claim that <i>mental states manifest in
outer form in the shape and size of the head;
and that certain areas of the skull are thus
associated with certain mental states, the size
and shape of the former denoting the degree
of activity of the latter</i>.</p>

<p>The general scheme of classification of the
various mental "faculties" of the phrenologists,
and the names given thereto by the
old phrenologists, have in the main been adhered
to in this book. In a number of cases,
however, we have seen fit to re-arrange the
groups in accordance with the later ideas of
the New Psychology, and have given to some
of the "faculties" names considered more
appropriate to the later classification, and
understanding of the mental state. Moreover,
in order to avoid the phrenological
theories attaching thereto, we have decided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
not to use the terms, "faculties," "propensities,"
and "sentiments," in referring to
the several mental states; and shall therefore
use the term "<i>Qualities</i>" in the place thereof.
The term "quality," while denoting "the
condition of being such or such; nature relatively
considered," does not carry with it
the theory attached to the phrenological term
"faculty." But the <i>locality</i> of the several
qualities of "faculties" has not been disturbed
or changed&mdash;the <i>place</i> where each
quality <i>manifests in outer form</i>, as assigned
in this book, agrees with that assigned by the
old phrenologists, time having served to establish
the truth of the same, rather than
to disprove it.</p>

<p>The following is the classification and
terminology adopted by us in this book in
the consideration of the Mental Qualities.
(See Fig. 1.)</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Egoistic Qualities</span>: Self-Esteem;
and Approbativeness.</p>

and Logic.</p>

Mysticism; Optimism; and Conscientiousness.</p>

<p>In the following several chapters we shall
consider each group, in turn, together with
the particular Qualities of each group. <i>It
must be remembered that the power of each
Quality is modified by the influence of the
other Qualities. Therefore in judging the
character of an individual, each and every
Quality must be taken into consideration.</i></p>

<small>THE EGOISTIC QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The first group of Qualities is that known
as the Egoistic Qualities, which is composed
of two particular Qualities, known, respectively,
as <i>Self-Esteem</i>; and <i>Approbativeness</i>.
This group manifests outer form immediately
at the "crown" of the head, and on
the sides directly beneath or "side of" the
crown. (See Fig. 2.) It is the seat of the
consciousness of Individuality and Personality,
and the tendencies arising directly
therefrom.</p>

THE EGOISTIC QUALITIES" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2</span><br />

THE EGOISTIC QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Self-Esteem.</span> This Quality manifests in
a strong sense of individual power, self-respect,
self-help, self-reliance, dignity, complacency,
pride of individuality, and independence.
In excess it tends to produce egotism,
abnormal conceit, imperiousness, etc.
Deficiency of it is apt to produce lack of confidence
in self, humility, self-depreciation,
etc. It gives to one the ambitious spirit, and
the desire for executive positions and places
of authority. It resents assumption of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
authority on the part of others, and chafes under
restraint. It renders its possessors dignified
and desirous of the respectful recognition
of others. It manifests outer form on the
middle line of the head, at the "crown" (see
group figure) just above Approbativeness,
where it may be perceived by reason of the
enlargement of the "crown." When fully
developed, it tends to draw back the head,
so that the latter is held erect; whereas, when
deficient it allows the head to droop forward
in an attitude lacking the appearance of
pride.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Approbativeness.</span> This Quality manifests
in a strong desire for praise, approval, flattery,
recommendation, fame, notoriety, good
name, personal display, show and outward
appearance. It is a form of pride different
from that of Self-Esteem, for it is a vanity
arising from personal things and outward
appearances, whereas Self-Esteem gives a
pride to the inner self or ego. Those in whom
it is well-developed pay great attention to
outward form, ceremony, etiquette, fashion,
and social recognition, and are always to be
found on the popular side and "with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
crowd." They thrive upon praise, approval
and notoriety, and shrink under censure, disapproval
or lack of notice. One with Self-Esteem
can be happy when alone, and in fact
often defies public opinion and fashion from
very pride of self; while one with Approbativeness
largely developed lacks the pride to
rise above approval and the opinion of others,
while possessing a strong sense of vanity
when public favor is bestowed. It manifests
outer form at the upper-back part of the
head, just above Cautiousness and below Self-Esteem,
(see group figure). When largely
developed it rises like two mounts on either
side of Self-Esteem, but when Self-Esteem is
large and Approbativeness is small, the latter
appears as two sunken places on either side
of Self-Esteem.</p>

<p>Self-Esteem values the <i>real self</i> while Approbativeness
values the <i>appearances</i> of personality.
The one pursues the substance, the
other the shadows. Self-Esteem and Approbativeness
are often confused in the minds of
the public. The true keynote of the first is
Pride; of the second, Vanity. The student
should learn to carefully distinguish between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
these two Qualities. Approbativeness may
cause one to make a monkey of himself in
order to win notice, praise or laughter, while
Self-Esteem will never sacrifice self-respect
and pride in order to win applause.</p>

<small>THE MOTIVE QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The second group is known as the Selfish
Qualities, and is composed of the following
particular Qualities: <i>Combativeness</i>; <i>Destructiveness</i>;
<i>Cunning</i>; <i>Cautiousness</i>; <i>Acquisitiveness</i>
and <i>Constructiveness</i>. This
group manifests in outer form extending
along the sides of the lower head from the
back toward the temples. (See Fig. 3.)</p>

THE MOTIVE QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Combativeness.</span> This Quality manifests
in a strong desire to oppose, resist, combat,
defy, defend. Those in whom it is developed
enjoy a "scrap," and, in the words of the
familiar saying, would "rather fight than
eat." When combined with Vitativeness it
manifests in the tendency to fight hard for
life. When combined with Acquisitiveness it
manifests in the tendency to fight for money
or property. When combined with Amativeness
it manifests in the tendency to fight for
mates. When combined with the family-loving
Qualities it manifests in a tendency to
fight for the family. In fact, its particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
direction is indicated by the development and
combination of the other Qualities. It manifests
in outer form at the sides of the lower-back
part of the head, a little back of the top
part of the ear (see group figure), giving,
when developed, enlargement of that part of
the head&mdash;a "broad back-head." The
"broad-headed" animals, birds, and fish have
this propensity well developed, while the
"narrow-heads" have it in but a small degree.
It is also indicated by the strong jaw,
and by the mouth indicating a "strong bite."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Destructiveness.</span> This Quality, manifests
in a strong desire to break precedents, doing
things in new ways, asserting authority, extermination,
severity, sternness, breaking
down, crushing, "walking over," etc. Its direction
is largely governed by the other Qualities,
as for instance in combination with
Acquisitiveness, it manifests in breaking
down opposition and precedents in business;
while with large conscientiousness it manifests
in tearing down evil conditions, etc.,
and in doing the work of "reform." It generally
is accompanied with large Combativeness,
as the two go hand-in-hand. It mani<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>fests
outer form directly above, and back of
the top-part of the ear (see group figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cunning.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong desire to be cunning, sly, close-mouthed,
diplomatic, deceitful, and generally
"foxy." It is best illustrated by the example
of the fox, which animal combines in itself
many of its qualities. The coyote also shows
signs of having this Quality well developed,
as do birds of the crow and blackbird family,
and certain fishes. With strong Caution it
renders one very secretive and "close-mouthed."
With strong Acquisitiveness it
renders one sly and tricky in business. With
strong Approbativeness it renders one apt to
tell lying stories which magnify his importance
and gratify his vanity. With a vivid
Imagination it inclines one to draw on that
quality and lie for the very love of romancing.
It manifests outer form a little distance
above the top of the ear, immediately above
Destructiveness, and back of Acquisitiveness
(see group figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cautiousness.</span> This Quality manifests in
a strong desire to avoid danger or trouble;
carefulness, prudence, watchfulness, anxiety,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
self-protection, etc. In excess it is apt to
render one fearful, over-anxious, and even
cowardly, but in combination with other
Qualities it tends to give to one a balance
and to restrain him from rashness and unnecessary
risk. Its direction is also largely
influenced by the development of other Qualities.
Thus with large Acquisitiveness it makes
one very cautious about money matters; with
large family qualities it renders one very
careful about the family; with large Approbativeness
it renders one bashful, self conscious,
and fearful of adverse criticism. It manifests
outer form toward the upper-back part of the
head, directly over Secretiveness (see group
figure), and when developed is apparent by
the enlargement of the comparatively large
area covered by it. An old phrenological
authority says of it: "This is the easiest found
of all the organs.... Starting at the middle
of the back part of the ears, draw a perpendicular
line, when the head is erect,
straight up to where the head begins to slope
back in forming the top, and Caution is located
just at the first turn."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Acquisitiveness.</span> This Quality manifests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
in a strong desire either to acquire, or else
to hold property, money, or general objects
of possession. In some cases it contents itself
with merely "getting," while in others it
also "holds on" to what is secured, the difference
arising from the combinations of the
other Qualities. In itself, it may be said to
be merely the tendency toward "hoarding
up," but the combination with large Combativeness
and Destructiveness enlarges its
scope and tends to make its possessor rapacious
and grasping. It is the instinct of
the squirrel and the bee, and even the dog
manifests it when he buries a bone for future
gnawing purposes. Those in whom it is developed
in connection with large Caution,
manifest a strict economy and even miserliness,
while in others it expends itself in
merely the getting for the sake of the getting,
the possessions often being scattered prodigally
afterward, the element of Approbativeness
entering largely into the latter action.
It manifests outer form in the lowest-middle
section of the head, directly over Alimentiveness
(see group figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Constructiveness.</span> This Quality mani<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>fests
in a strong desire to invent, construct,
build, create, put together, improve upon,
add to, readjust, etc. It manifests along three
general lines, namely (1) Invention; (2) Construction;
and (3) Materialization, by which
is meant the "making real" of <i>ideals</i> previously
entertained&mdash;the "making come true"
of the dreams previously experienced&mdash;the
<i>materialization</i> of the ideas, plans, and projects
previously <i>visualized</i>. This Quality
causes the person to improve, alter, tinker
with, build up, invent, and create along the
lines of his vocation or avocation. These
people find it difficult to refrain from tinkering
with, altering, or "improving" anything
and everything with which they have to do.
With large Logic, Analysis, and Perceptives
they manifest inventive ability; with large
Imitation they are fond of copying and constructing
after models; with large Ideality
they work toward making their dreams come
true. This Quality is not confined to mechanical
construction, as the old phrenologists
taught, but manifests itself in business literature,
art, and in fact in every vocation or occupation.
With large Destructiveness, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
builds up new structures upon the ruins
created by that Quality. In persons of the
Motive temperament it inclines toward mechanical
invention, creation and construction;
while in persons of the Mental temperament
it manifests in creating and constructing
ideas, thoughts, theories, scientific classification,
literary productions, etc., and in persons
of the Vital temperament it manifests
in creating and improving upon things calculated
to appeal to persons of that class.
It manifests outer form in the lower and
frontal part of the temples, backward and
upward from the outer corner of the eye-brow
(see group figure). Prof. O. S. Fowler says.
"In broad-built and stocky persons it causes
this part of the temples to widen and bulge
out, but in tall, long-headed persons it <i>spreads</i>
out upon them, and hence shows to be less
than it really is." It is directly below Ideality
and in front of Acquisitiveness.</p>

<small>THE VITATIVE QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The third group is known as the Vitative
Qualities, which is composed of the three
respective particular Qualities: <i>Vitativeness</i>;
<i>Alimentativeness</i>; and <i>Bibativeness</i>. This
group manifests in outer form directly back
of, and in front of, the middle part of the
ear. (See Fig. 4.)</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4</span><br />

THE VITATIVE QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Vitativeness.</span> This quality manifests in
a strong desire to live; resistance to disease
and death; an intense clinging to life for the
mere fact of living, rather than for the sake
of anything to be accomplished by continued
existence. It goes along with Combativeness,
and is especially noticeable in the "broad-headed"
people and animals. The cat tribe,
hawks, turtles, sharks, venomous snakes, and
others have this propensity well developed,
while it is deficient in the "narrow-headed"
animals, such as the rabbit, certain birds, certain
fish, and many harmless snakes. Those
in whom it is developed "die hard," while
those in whom it is deficient die easily. This<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
capacity manifests in outer form in the area
situated just back of the middle part of the
ear (see group figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alimentiveness.</span> This Quality manifests
in a strong desire to gratify the tastes for
food, when large it inclines one toward gluttony,
and tends to make one "live to eat,"
instead of to "eat to live." Those in whom
it is largely developed eat heartily and like
to see others doing the same; while those in
whom it is deficient care very little for the
quality or amount of their food and often
actually resent the, to them, "disgusting"
sight of persons partaking of a hearty meal.
It manifests in outer form immediately in
front of the upper part of the ear (see group
figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bibativeness.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong desire to gratify the appetite for
drinks of various kinds. In its normal well-developed
state it manifests in a desire for
water, milk and fluid foods, such as soups,
broths, etc., and other juicy things. Perverted
it manifests in the appetite for intoxicating
liquors, tea and coffee, "soft drinks,"
and the various decoctions of the modern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
soda-fountain. By some this Quality is regarded
as merely a phase of Alimentiveness,
while others consider it to be a separate Quality.
It manifests in outer form immediately
in front of the locality of Alimentiveness,
toward the eye.</p>

<small>THE EMOTIVE QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The fourth group is that known as the
Social Qualities, which group is composed of
the following particular Qualities: <i>Amativeness</i>;
<i>Conjugality</i>; <i>Parental Love</i>; <i>Sociability</i>
and <i>Home Love</i>. This group manifests
outer form at the lower-back portion of the
head (see Fig. 5), and shows itself by an
enlargement of that region, causing the head
to "bulge" back of the ears. It may best be
understood by an examination of its several
particular Qualities.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

THE EMOTIVE QUALITIES" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 5</span><br />

THE EMOTIVE QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Amativeness.</span> This Quality manifests in
a strong desire for sexual indulgence and association
with the opposite sex. Its purpose
is, of course, the reproduction of the race, but
its abuse and perversion has led man to many
excesses and unnatural practices. It is a
dynamic propensity and its normal development
is seemingly necessary in order to produce
the "life spirit," and vital activity mental
and physical. Those in whom it is deficient
lack "spirit" and energy, while those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
in whom it is developed to excess tend to
lean toward excesses. When developed
normally it seems to add an attractiveness
or "magnetism" to its possessors; when
deficient it renders the person "cold" non-magnetic
and unattractive; when over-developed
and unrestrained it causes the person
to become disgusting and repulsive to the
normal person; vulgar, licentious and depraved.
Its seat is in the cerebellum or
"little brain," and it manifests outer form
by an enlarged "fullness" at the nape of the
neck, at the base of the skull (see group figure).
It tends to cause the head to lean backward
and downward at the nape of the neck.
It also manifests by fullness of the lips, particularly
in their middles. The lips and position
of the head of persons in whom this
quality is largely developed is indicative of
the attitude and position of kissing. Spurzheim
says of it: "It is situated at the top
of the neck, and its size is proportionate to
the space between the mastoid process, immediately
behind the ears, and the occipital
spine, in the middle of the hind head." It is
noticeable that those in whom this quality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
is fully or largely developed seem to have
the power of attracting or "charming" those
of the opposite sex, while those who are deficient
in it lack this quality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conjugality.</span> This quality manifests in
a strong desire for a "mate"&mdash;and <i>one</i> mate
only. While Amativeness may cause one to
seek the society of many of the opposite sex,
Conjugality will act only to cause one to seek
the <i>one</i> life partner. Conjugality causes the
desire to "mate for life." It is something
quite different from Amativeness, although
of course related to it. The location of its
outer form, between Amativeness and
Friendship, gives the key to its quality&mdash;<i>love
with companionship</i>. Those in whom it is
well developed are very close to their mates
and tend toward jealousy; they suffer intensely
when the relation is inharmonious or
disturbed in any way, and are often brokenhearted
at disappointment in love or the
death of the mate. Those in whom it is deficient
feel very little true companionship for
their mates, and with Amativeness large are
apt to be promiscuous in their manifestation
of love or passion; if one love is interrupted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
or interfered with they find little difficulty in
shifting their affections. Those in whom it is
strong are "true unto death," while those in
whom it is weak are fickle, inconstant and
lack loyalty. The Quality manifests outer
form on each side of the lower-back of the
head, just above Amativeness and just below
Friendship, and on either side of Parental
Love&mdash;the location being especially indicative
of its nature (see group figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Parental Love.</span> This Quality manifests
in a strong desire for and love of children,
particularly one's own. Those in whom it is
very strong often adopt children in addition
to their own and love to caress children wherever
and whenever they may see them. It
manifests outer form at the lower-back part
of the head on the middle-line of the head,
above Amativeness, and below Inhabitiveness
(see group figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sociability.</span> This Quality manifests in
a strong desire for companionship, fellowship,
friends, sympathy, society, associates,
etc. It is the "social sense." Those in whom
it is strong feel happy only when surrounded
by associates, friends or boon companions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
They incline toward lodges, clubs and social
gatherings. To be alone is to suffer, to such
people. Those in whom it is weak prefer to
be alone, or at the best with a few carefully
chosen companions, and avoid promiscuous
friendships and social gatherings. It manifests
outer form just above Conjugality, and
at the sides of Parental love and Inhabitiveness,
and directly back of Cautiousness and
the upper-part of Combativeness (see group
figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Home-Love.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong love of familiar places, particularly
of one's home and near-by country, and from
this springs love of country and patriotism.
Those in whom it is strong dislike to travel,
and are subject to home-sickness. Those in
whom it is weak are fond of travel, readily
change their places of abode, and are apt
to become "roamers" if they indulge the
Quality. When over large, it inclines one
toward narrowness, sectionalism and provincialism;
when small, it inclines one
toward frequent moves, and changes of residence
and location. It manifests outer form
at the back part of the head, on the middle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>-line,
directly above Parental Love and below
Continuity (see group figure). When it is
large it tends to produce a ridge, flat-iron-shape
and pointing upward; when small, it
presents a depression sufficient to contain the
ball of the finger. Its close connection to
Continuity, on the one hand, and Parental
Love on the other, is very suggestive.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE APPLICATIVE QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The fifth group, known as the Applicative
Qualities, is composed of two particular
Qualities, known, respectively, as <i>Firmness</i>
and <i>Continuity</i>. This group manifests in
outer form on the centre-line of the head,
just above and just below the "crown,"
at which latter point Self-Esteem is situated
(see Fig. 6).</p>

THE APPLICATIVE QUALITIES" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6</span><br />

THE APPLICATIVE QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Firmness.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong tendency toward stability, tenacity,
fixedness of purpose, and decision. When
very highly developed with the reasoning
powers weak it often manifests as stubborness,
mulishness, obstinacy, etc. Those in
whom it is largely developed display firmness
in decision, are "set in their ways,"
cannot be driven by force or converted by
argument when they have once formed an
opinion and taken a stand. The "indomitable
will" arises from this Quality, in fact
this Quality might well be termed the "Will
Quality," although it manifests by that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
aspect of Will which shows itself as <i>fixedness</i>,
while its companion Quality, that of Continuity,
manifests the phase of Will known as
"stick-to-it-iveness." Persons in whom
Firmness is largely developed make certain
decisions and then abide by them. They
may be coaxed but never driven. Prof. O. S.
Fowler, speaking of this Quality, said: "No
man ever succeeded without great will-power
to hold on and hold out in the teeth of opposing
difficulties. I never knew a man distinguished
for anything, not even crimes, to lack
it. It is an indispensable prerequisite of
greatness and goodness. Without it great
talents are of little avail, for they accomplish
little; but with it large, fair to middling capacities
accomplish commendable results.
Success in life depends more on this than on
any other single attribute."</p>

<p>This Quality manifests outer form on the
centre-line of the back part of the top head,
just above Self-Esteem. The location may
be ascertained by holding the head erect,
drawing an imaginary line upward from the
opening of the ears straight to the top of the
head to the middle-line or centre of the top<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of the head&mdash;the location is at this last-point.
It is usually quite prominent, and in many
men unusually large. When fully developed
it gives a "tallness" to the head from the
opening of the ears to top of head. When
it is weak, there is apt to be a flatness or
even a depression at the point of its location.
It also manifests in a "stiff upper lip," that
is a firm upper lip, the latter often being
longer than ordinarily. A certain stiffness
of the upper-lip is often noticed when Firmness
is habitually asserted, or in cases when
the Quality is temporarily called into play.
The term "stiff upper lip" is more than a
mere figurative expression. Combe says of
this Quality: "When this organ predominates
it gives a peculiar hardness to the manner,
a stiffness and uprightness to the gait,
with a forcible and emphatic tone to the
voice."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Continuity.</span> This propensity manifests
in a strong tendency to "stick-to" a thing
once begun, until it is finished; a disinclination
for change; a habit of patient work
and thought; a desire to do but one thing at
a time; etc. It is difficult to interest these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
people in <i>new</i> things&mdash;they hold fast to the
<i>old</i>. They are naturally conservative and
are averse to "new-fangled" things. They
are plodders and steady workers, and run on
like a clock when once wound up. They are
apt to possess the power of long and continued
concentration upon anything which
attracts their attention, although it is difficult
to attract their attention to an entirely new
thing. Prof. Sizer says: "Firmness gives a
stiff, determined fortitude, decision of character;
it serves to brace up the other faculties
to the work in hand.... Firmness
gives determination and obstinacy of purpose,
while <i>Continuity</i> gives a patient, perfecting,
plodding application. Of two stone-cutters
with equal Firmness, they will be
alike thorough and persevering, but if one
has large Continuity he prefers to use the
drill in one place for hours, while the other
with small Continuity craves variety, and
prefers to use the chisel in cutting and dressing
the entire surface of the stone."</p>

<p>Continuity in excess often manifests in
"long-windedness," prosiness, boredom, prolixity
and tiresomeness. When it is weak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
there is manifested a "flightiness," tendency
to change, lack of concentration, attraction
of the new, a shifting of base, change of mind,
and general instability and lack of "stick-to-itiveness."
This Quality manifests outer
form on the centre line of the top back of the
head, just below the crown (Self-Esteem)
and just above Inhabitiveness (see group
figure). Reference to the group figure will
show that it is peculiar in shape, and forms a
semi-circular arch over a part of the top-back
head. When fully developed that part
of the head is simply evenly rounded with
swelling; when deficient it leaves a hollow,
crescent shape, horns downward. In
America we find the majority of people are
weak in Continuity, while in certain other
countries it is found largely developed in the
majority of cases. This fact gives to Americans
a benefit in certain directions and a
weakness in others.</p>

<p>Both Firmness and Continuity are manifested
almost entirely in connection with the
other Qualities, and are known almost altogether
in that way. In themselves they have
almost abstract nature. In determining char<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>acter,
they must be taken largely into consideration,
because their influence on the
other Qualities is very great. In fact they
may be said to <i>determine</i> the degree of <i>application</i>
of the other Qualities.</p>

<small>THE MODIFICATIVE QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The sixth group is known as the Modificative
Qualities (called by the phrenologists
"The Self-Perfecting Group"), which is
composed of the following particular Qualities.
<i>Ideality</i>, <i>Infinity</i> and <i>Humor</i>, respectively.
This group manifests outer form in
the region of the temples, and when large
gives width to the sides of the fore part of
the head (See Figure 7).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ideality.</span> This Quality could well be called
the "Artistic" quality of the mind. It manifests
in a strong desire for the beautiful, the
ideal, the elegant, the polished, the graceful,
the refined. It is also closely connected with
the phase of mental activity called "Imagination."
Those in whom it is largely developed
manifest the artistic taste and temperament,
the love of art, beauty and the
ideal, the poetic spirit, the love of the refined
and choice&mdash;and a corresponding dislike
for all opposed to these tastes and qualities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

THE MODIFICATIVE QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>Spurzheim says of it: "A poetic turn of
mind results from a peculiar mode of feeling.
Vividness, glow, exaltation, imagination,
inspiration, rapture, exaggeration, and
warmth of expression are requisite for
poetry. Poets depict a fictitious and imaginary
world. This faculty gives glow to the
other faculties; impresses the poetical and
ideal; aspires to imaginary perfection in
every thing; creates enthusiasm in friendship,
virtue, painting, music, etc.; produces
sentimentality, and leads to delicacy and susceptibility.
It often acts with Spirituality
(Mysticism), located adjoining it, in embellishing
poetry with the mysterious and supernatural.
Practical exaltation varies with
this organ."</p>

<p>Combe says: "This faculty loves exquisiteness,
perfection, and the beau-ideal; gives
inspiration to the poet; stimulates those faculties
which form ideas to create perfect
scenes; inspires man with a ceaseless love of
improvement, and prompts him to form and
realize splendid conceptions; imparts an elevated
strain to language, and shows a splendor
of eloquence and poetic feeling; and gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
to conversation a fascinating sprightliness
and buoyancy&mdash;the opposite of dryness and
dullness."</p>

<p>In addition to the above characteristics,
which are largely due to the co-operation of
Mysticism, Infinity, and Reverence, there is
another set of manifestations which were
largely overlooked by the older phrenologists&mdash;the
activity of the Imagination in connection
with Constructiveness. This combination
of Constructiveness and Ideality is
found in the great scientists, inventors, great
financiers, and others whose plans for "building
up" show that Ideality has been also very
active in the direction of picturing "what
may be"&mdash;the <i>ideal</i> which Construction
makes <i>real</i>. In much mental constructive
work, there is found the artistic element,
which arises from Ideality. This Quality
manifests outer form in the upper and frontal
portion of the temples, just where the
head begins to curve upward, and just in
front of, or under, the edges of the hair (see
group figure). It is just above Constructiveness,
and just below Mysticism and Imitation,
a position which throws light on its several
phases of manifestation above noted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Infinity.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong realization of the grand, the majestic,
the vast, the illimitable, the infinite, the
eternal, the absolute, the omnipotent, the omnipresent,
the omniscient. It is the realizing
sense of The Great. Those in whom it is
large are impressed by the sublime, the majestic,
the grand, in nature or in thought and
conception. Niagara; the great work of the
architect; the thunder-storm; the giant redwood
of California; the ocean; or the
thoughts of Infinity, alike appeal to the one
in whom this Quality is large. If Reverence
be large, the trend of Infinity will be toward
religious ideas&mdash;the greatness of God. If the
intellectual faculties be in the ascendency, Infinity
will lead to high conceptions of Space,
Nature, the Infinite. If Ideality be large,
Infinity will incline toward the grand and
great in art. If Constructiveness be well developed,
Infinity will impel to the creation of
great works, enterprises, buildings, schemes,
or what not. Infinity influences everything
in the direction of largeness and greatness.
This Quality manifests in outer form on the
side of the head, about midway between fore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>head
and back-head, and about midway between
"top and bottom" of that part of the
head which contains the brain (see group
figure). It is back of Ideality, and in front
of Cautiousness; below Optimism and above
Acquisitiveness, on the side of the head
where the upward curve begins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humor.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong appreciation of the ludicrous, humorous,
ironical, facetious, and raillery. Spurzheim
says: "Those who write like Voltaire,
Rabelais, Piron, Sterne, Rabener, Wieland,
and all who are fond of jest, raillery, ridicule,
irony, and comical conceptions, have the upper
and outer parts of the forehead immediately
before Beauty (Ideality) of considerable
size." Combe says: "I have found
in the manifestations of those whose Wit
(Mirthfulness) predominates over Causality
(Logic) a striking love of the purely ludicrous;
their great delight being to heap
absurd and incongruous ideas together; extract
laughter out of every object; and enjoy
the mirth their sallies created; and therefore
agree with Spurzheim that the sentiment
of the ludicrous is its primitive func<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>tion."
Those in whom it is very large are
apt to be regarded as trifling and undignified,
and people often lack respect for them. Those
in whom it is weak are apt to be over-serious
and dreary. A sense of humor is valuable
in many ways, among which is its influence
in letting us see the silly side of much pretentious
nonsense which might otherwise deceive
our reason and judgment. Many a
solemn and dignified fallacy or error can best
be attacked through a laugh and a realization
of its absurdity. This Quality manifests
outer form on the upper and lateral part of
the forehead (see group figure). It is just
before Ideality and just below Imitation.
When large it gives a square and prominent
shape to this part of the forehead.</p>

<small>THE RELATIVE QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The seventh group is known as the Relative
Qualities, and is composed of the following
four particular Qualities: <i>Human Nature</i>;
<i>Suavity</i>; <i>Sympathy</i>; and <i>Imitation</i>; respectively.
The designation "Relative" is applied
to this group, by reason of the fact that
its activities are concerned with the <i>relations</i>
between the individual and others of his kind.
The group manifests outer form in the front-upper
part of the head, beginning just above
the line of the hair, from which it extends
backward toward the top-head. (See Fig. 8.)</p>

THE RELATIVE QUALITIES" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8</span><br />

THE RELATIVE QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Human Nature.</span> This Quality manifests in
a strong desire to read character, discern human
motives, interpret feelings and thoughts,
and to <i>know</i> men and women thoroughly.
Those in whom it is large seem to read the
mind, motives and character of those whom
they meet, in an almost intuitive manner&mdash;the
ideas, feelings, thoughts, motives and designs
of others seem like an open book to them.
They are natural physiognomists, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
understand Human Nature in both its inner states
and outer forms. This quality is largely developed
in successful salesmen, detectives,
credit-men, politicians, and others whose success
depends largely upon the ability to read
the character of those with whom they come
in contact. This Quality concerns itself with
the entire subject matter of this book, and is
of the utmost importance to every individual.
It should be developed and trained.</p>

<p>Prof. O. S. Fowler explains its manifestations,
and at the same time directs one along
the lines of its cultivation, as follows: "Scan
closely all the actions of men, in order to ascertain
their motives and mainsprings of action;
look with a sharp eye at man, woman
and child, all you meet, as if you would read
them through; note particularly the expression
of the eye, as if you would imbibe what it
signifies; say to yourself, what faculty
prompted this expression and that action?
drink in the general looks, attitude, natural
language and manifestations of men, and
yield yourself to the impressions naturally
made on you; that is, study human nature
both as a philosophy and a sentiment."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>This Quality manifests in outer form on the
middle-line of the summit of the forehead,
just where the hair usually begins to appear,
and from thence slightly upward around the
curve (see group figure). It is directly above
Analysis and is often mistaken for a continuation
thereof. Its nearness to that Quality indicates
its relationship thereto, the connection
being very close; in fact, some authorities
have treated it as a particular phase of Analysis.
It is directly in front of and below
Sympathy, which position is also suggestive,
for we must first <i>understand</i> the feelings of
others before we can sympathize with them.
It is between the two lobes of Suavity, which
position is also suggestive, for Suavity depends
upon an understanding of the character
and feelings of others, in order that we may
"fall in" with the same. In the same way
Imitation, which closely adjoins it, depends
upon Human Nature for its copying material.
When largely developed this Quality gives a
peculiar fullness and height to the upper forehead.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Suavity.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong desire to be <i>agreeable</i>, <i>suave</i>, <i>pleasant</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
<i>polite</i> and <i>attractive</i> to other people. Those
in whom it is large possess a charming personality;
a "winning way;" are interesting
and agreeable; polite, and often fascinating.
They always say the right thing to the right
person at the right time and right place.
They sugar-coat unpleasant truths, and are
natural diplomats. This is the Quality of
Tact. These people are "all things to all
men," and show every evidence of having
"kissed the Blarney Stone," and of understanding
the manufacture and use of "soft
soap."</p>

<p>With Human Nature large, they, as
Prof. O. S. Fowler says "know just how
and when to take and hoodwink men; with
Secretiveness (Cunning) large and Conscientiousness
small, are oily and palavering, and
flatter victims, and serpent-like salivate before
swallowing." When the adjoining Quality
of Humor is large, they add humor and wit
to their other attractive qualities. This Quality,
in normal development, is the lubricant
which makes the wheels of social and business
intercourse run smoothly. In excess it renders
one "too smooth" and "oily;" while its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
deficiency renders one boorish, unattractive
and disagreeable. It manifests in outer form
in the upper-fore part of the head, about the
hair-line, and <i>on each side of Human Nature</i>.
It is just below Imitation, just above Logic,
and touches the upper side of Mirthfulness
(see group figure). Together with Human
Nature, when both are large, it tends to give
a squareness and fullness to the upper part of
the forehead, and a somewhat angular turn
to the forehead at that point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sympathy.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong feeling of kindness, compassion, benevolence,
sympathy, and desire to make and
see others happy. Its manifestation is always
altruistic. When largely developed it
causes one to feel the pains of others, and to
be unhappy at the sight, thought or hearing
of their pains and woes. When deficient or
weak it allows the person to be callous to the
misfortunes of others. When normally developed
it causes one to radiate Kindness,
Sympathy and Compassion, but in excess it
renders one miserable because of the consciousness
of the "world-pain," and often
causes one to be the victim of misplaced sym<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>pathy
and confidence. It is unnecessary to
state that those in whom this propensity is
strong are to be found serving their fellow-men
in charitable, philanthropic, and educational
work. Some have it in such excess that
they will impoverish themselves and their
families in order to help perfect strangers
or the race at large. It manifests outer form
on the fore part of the top head, on the middle-line,
commencing just about where the
hair begins and running back almost to the
middle of the top-head. It is immediately in
front of Reverence. When large it tends to
give the head a little forward tilt or inclination,
as if toward the person for whom sympathy
is felt. In listening to a story awakening
sympathy, one naturally inclines the head
a little forward.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Imitation.</span> This Quality manifests itself
in the strong tendency to reproduce, copy,
take pattern of, or mimic. It plays an important
part in the work of the artist and the
actor. It enables one in whom it is largely
developed to enter into the ideas, plans and
works of others; to "catch their spirit;" and
to reproduce their work or ideas. In connec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>tion
with Ideality it forms a large part of the
artistic talent in all lines of creative work.
With large Constructiveness and Ideality, it
makes the inventor and the designer who build
upon that which has gone before that which
is new and original. With Self-Esteem small
and Approbativeness large, this Quality will
cause the person to "follow my leader" and
imitate others, rather than to assert his own
originality and creative power. This Quality
is noticeable principally as a modifier of the
other faculties and propensities. It manifests
outer form on the upper sides of the
forehead, toward the top of the head (see
group figure). It lies just below Sympathy,
and above Ideality; before Mysticism, and
back of Suavity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>THE PERCEPTIVE QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The eighth group is known as the Perceptive
Qualities, composed of the following particular
Qualities, respectively: <i>Observation</i>;
<i>Form</i> <i>Size</i>; <i>Weight</i>; <i>Color</i>; <i>Order</i>; <i>Calculation</i>;
<i>Tune</i>; <i>Time</i>; <i>Locality</i>; <i>Eventuality</i>, and
<i>Words</i>. This group manifests outer form in
the lower part of the forehead, in the region
of the eye. (See Fig. 9.) When large this
group often gives to the upper forehead the
appearance of "retreating" or sloping backward.
Prof. O. S. Fowler says of the appearance
of those Qualities which manifest outer
form <i>under</i> the eyebrows: "The following
rule for observing their size obviates the objection
sometimes urged that the eyebrows
and their arches prevent the correct diagnosis
of these smaller organs crowded so thickly together.
The rule is: <i>The shape of the eyebrows</i>
reveals the size, absolute and relative,
of each, thus: When <i>all</i> are large, the eyebrow
is long and arching; when all are deficient,
it is short and straight; when some are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
large and others small, it arches over the
large ones, but passes horizontally over those
which are small. This rule is infallible."
The other Qualities of the group, according
to Prof. Sizer, "is located above the eyes,
and ... constitute about one-third of the
depth of the forehead, beginning at the arch
of the eye."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

THE PERCEPTIVE QUALITIES" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 9</span><br />

THE PERCEPTIVE QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Observation.</span> This Quality was given the
name of "Individuality" by the early phrenologists,
but this term is considered misleading,
owing to the later usage of that term.
It manifests in a strong desire to observe, see,
examine, inspect, and "know" the things of
the objective life. Those in whom it is largely
developed feel the insatiable urge of the inquisitive
spirit; they desire to investigate
everything coming under their notice. Many
little details in the objects or subjects in
which they are interested are noticed by them,
while overlooked by the majority of people.</p>

<p>Prof. Sizer says of it that it "gives a recognition
of things and the special points and
facts of subjects; quickness of observation is
an important element in the acquisition of
knowledge.... Those in whom it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
large are eager to see all that may be seen, and
nothing escapes their attention. It opens the
door for the action of all the other perceptive
organs.... They are quick to notice
everything that is presented to the eye; and
it goes farther, and enables us to recognize
that which we touch, or sounds we hear. The
rattling strokes of a drum are distinct noises,
and each is an individuality."</p>

<p>Prof. O. S. Fowler, says: "It is adapted,
and adapts men to the divisibility of matter,
or that natural attribute which allows it to be
subdivided indefinitely. Yet each division
maintains a personal existence. It thus puts
man in relation and contact with a world full
of things for his inspection, as well as excites
in him an insatiable desire to examine
everything. It is therefore the <i>looking</i> faculty.
Its distinctive office is to observe
things. It asks: 'What is this?' and says,
'Show me that!'... Before we can
know the uses, properties, causes, etc., of
things, we must first know that such things
<i>exist</i>, and of this Observation informs us."</p>

<p>This Quality is largely involved in the process
of Attention. It usually manifests in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
form of <i>involuntary attention</i>, that is, attention
to interesting things. But, under the influence
of the will, with Firmness large, it
manifests <i>voluntary attention</i>, or attention or
study of objects not interesting in themselves,
but which it is important to study and know.
It is largely developed in children and undeveloped
adults in the phase of curiosity or
desire to observe <i>new</i> things. In adults, of
developed minds, it manifests as attention to
things of <i>material interest</i> and important subjects
or objects of study. This Quality is the
master of its associated Qualities in this
group, and is involved in all of their activities.</p>

<p>It manifests outer form in the middle of the
lower part of the forehead, between the inner
ends of the eyebrows, and above the top of the
nose&mdash;"just above the root of the nose," in
fact. Prof. O. S. Fowler says: "When it is
large, the eyebrows flex downward at their
nasal ends, and the lower part of the forehead
projects. When it is deficient, the eyebrows
are straight at their inner ends, and
come close together" (See group figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Form.</span> This Quality manifests in a cognizance,
appreciation, and recollection of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
<i>form and shape</i> of objects observed. Those
in whom it is large most readily perceive,
recognize and remember details of form and
shape, faces, etc. It manifests outer form between,
and slightly above, the eyes, on each
side of Observation (see group figure).
When large it tends to push the eyes apart
and outward. Sizer says: "The width between
the eyes is the indication of its development....
When small the eyes are
nearer together, which gives a pinched expression
to that part of the face; when the organ
is large, the eyes appear to be separated,
pushing away from the root of the nose. Distinguished
artists have the eyes widely separated."
Audobon said of Bewick, an eminent
English wood-engraver, "His eyes were
placed farther apart than those of any man
I have ever seen."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Size.</span> This Quality manifests in a cognizance,
appreciation, and recollection of the
size and <i>magnitude</i> of objects observed.
Those in whom it is large most readily perceive,
recognize and remember the size, dimensions,
proportion, distance, height and
depth, quantity, bulk of things. It manifests<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
outer form on each side of Observation, but a
little lower down (see group figure), in the
angle formed by the root of the nose and arch
of the eyebrows. Prof. O. S. Fowler says:
"In proportion as it is large it causes the inner
portion of the eyebrows to project over
the inner portions of the eyes, quite like
the eaves of a house, forming a shed over the
inner portion of each eye."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Weight.</span> This Quality manifests in a cognizance,
appreciation, and recollection of
<i>weight</i>, <i>balance and gravity</i> of things. Those
in whom it is large most readily perceive,
recognize, and remember the weight of
things; and also things out of balance or
plumb. These people seem to have the faculty
of balancing themselves nicely, and keeping
their feet on a slippery surface, on a tight-rope,
etc., and often walk with a swinging,
free motion, indicating a sense of balance
and security. This Quality manifests under
the eyebrows, next to Size, about a half inch
from the upper part of the nose, rising somewhat
above the inner part of the eyeball and
the bridge of the nose. Prof. O. S. Fowler
says: "Draw a perpendicular line from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
centre of each eye up to the eyebrow;
Weight is <i>internally</i>, and Color <i>externally</i> of
this line under the eyebrows."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color.</span> This Quality manifests in a cognizance,
appreciation, and recollection of the
color, hue, shade, and tint of things. Those
in whom it is large most readily perceive,
recognize and remember the colors, shadings,
blendings and combination of tints, and to
compare, match and harmonize colors instinctively.
It manifests outer form under the
eyebrows, just back of Weight (see rule for
finding, in last paragraph), and occupies the
space directly under the centre of the arch
of the eyebrows (see group figure). When
largely developed it gives an upward and forward
arch to the eyebrows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Order.</span> This Quality manifests in a cognizance,
appreciation, and recollection of
<i>order</i>, <i>method and arrangement</i>. Those in
whom it is large most readily perceive, recognize,
and remember the order and sequence
in which objects appear or are arranged.
They are very methodical, precise, and pay attention
to details of arrangement and system.
They "have a place for everything," and like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
to "keep everything in its place." In business
they are "strong on system," sometimes
overdoing it. They are also fond of rules,
laws, customs, and codes, and adhere strictly
thereto. They like everything pigeon-holed,
labelled, or else fenced in and off from every
other thing. Are also great disciplinarians.
This Quality manifests outer form next to
Color, and beneath the junction of the bony
ridges (on the sides of the head) and the eyebrows,
(see group figure). Prof. O. S. Fowler
says: "When very large it forms an arch,
almost an angle, in the eyebrows at this point,
accompanied by its projection or hanging
over.... When small, the eyebrows at
this point retire, and are straight and flat,
wanting that arched projection given by large
Order." Combe says: "Its large development
produces a square appearance at the
external angle of the lower part of the forehead."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calculation.</span> This Quality manifests in a
cognizance, appreciation, and recollection of
<i>number</i>, <i>figures</i>, <i>calculations</i>, <i>etc.</i> Those in
whom it is largely developed most readily perceive,
recognize, and remember anything con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>cerned
with the <i>number</i> of things, or calculations
based thereon. They are natural arithmeticians
and mathematicians. Calculation
comes easy to them, and in cases of high development
they may be said to "think mathematically."
This Quality manifests outer
form next to Order, and under the outer ends
of the eyebrows (see group figure).</p>

<p>Prof. O. S. Fowler, says: "It elongates the
ends of the eyebrows laterally, and flexes
them horizontally in proportion as it is developed,
yet when deficient the eyebrow is left
short externally, does not project beyond the
eye, and terminates running <i>downwards</i>."
Gall says: "Its convolution is a continuation
of the lowest convolution of Tune, and is
placed on the most external part of the orbital
plate, in a furrow running from before backwards.
When it is very large it depresses
the external part of the plate, so that the superorbital
arch is irregular, except in its internal
part; its external line representing a
straight line, which descends obliquely.
Hence the external part of the eyelid is depressed,
and conceals the corresponding part
of the eye."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tune.</span> This Quality manifests in a cognizance,
appreciation, and recollection of
<i>tune</i>, <i>music</i>, <i>harmony</i>, <i>melody</i>, etc. Those in
whom it is large most readily perceive, recognize,
and remember all connected with the
subject of Music. It is the musical sense,
taste and faculty. Its characteristics are too
well-known to require elaboration. It manifests
outer form in the lateral and lower part
of the forehead, above Order and Calculation,
in front of Constructiveness, and back of
Time (see group figure). Prof. O. S. Fowler
says: "When large it fills out the lower,
frontal portions of the temples....
Still, being located in a kind of corner
... and the temporal muscle passing over
it, its position varies somewhat, which renders
observation more difficult, except in the
heads of children, in whom it is generally
larger than in adults."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Time.</span> This Quality manifests in a cognizance,
appreciation, and recollection of <i>time</i>,
<i>duration</i>, <i>rhythm</i>, <i>etc.</i> Those in whom it is
large most readily perceive, recognize, and
remember all connected with the flight of
time, dates, duration, periodicity, chronology,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
etc. Spurzheim says of it that it, "perceives
the duration, simultaneousness, and succession
of phenomena." It may be called "the
time sense" which is so apparent in some persons,
and so noticeable by reason of its absence
in others. It manifests outer form
above Color and Weight, in front of Tune,
and back of Locality (see group figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Locality.</span> This Quality manifests in a cognizance,
appreciation, and recollection of
<i>places</i>, <i>positions</i>, <i>locations</i>, <i>directions</i>, etc.
Those in whom it is large most readily perceive,
recognize, and remember places, directions,
positions, land-marks, points-of-the
compass, roads, paths, streets, and other
things having to do with <i>space</i>. Such persons
are never "lost" nor confused as to direction
or locality; they have an almost instinctive
"sense of direction." It is the geographical
or traveller's sense. It is found large in the
majority of travellers, sailors, civil engineers,
etc. Persons in whom it is large can find
themselves about a strange city without
trouble, and will remember old scenes, places,
locations for years. Those in whom it is weak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
frequently "get lost," or mixed up regarding
place, position and direction.</p>

<p>It manifests outer form over Size and
Weight, or about three-quarters of an inch
above the inner half of the eyebrows, and
runs upwards and outwards (see group
figure). It is said to have been immensely
developed and apparent in Capt. Cook, the
eminent explorer, and the portraits of Columbus
and other great explorers and travellers
show a distinct enlargement of this locality.
Gall, who discovered the location of
this Quality, took casts of the heads of noted
explorers and travellers, and others manifesting
the "sense of place and direction," and
upon comparing them, "found in them all, in
the region directly over the eyes, two large
prominences, which began just inside the root
of the nose, and ascended obliquely upwards
and outwards as far as the middle of the forehead."
Dr. Caldwell states that, "Daniel
Boone who was perpetually going from one
place to another, was the most celebrated
hunter and woodsman of his age, and possessed
this organ in a degree of development<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
so bold and prominent that it deformed his
face."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eventuality.</span> This Quality manifests in
a cognizance appreciation and recollection
of <i>facts</i>, <i>events</i>, <i>happenings</i>, <i>occurrences</i>,
<i>news</i>, <i>etc.</i> Those in whom it is large most
readily perceive, recognize and remember
striking events, facts, doings, occurrences&mdash;in
short, <i>news</i>. Such persons have the "nose for
news" which is so important to the newspaper
man, scientific investigator, researcher
in any line, and general investigator. It is
the "historical faculty," and the "journalistic
sense," as well as an important part of
the "scientific instinct." These people make
good witnesses, story tellers, and entertainers.
They know "what is going on," and are the
people to go to when one wishes to "hear the
news," or to learn the past history of anything
or anybody.</p>

<p>This Quality manifests outer form in the
centre of the forehead, immediately above Observation,
and in front of Locality (see
group figure). When large it tends to "fill
out" the middle of the forehead. Prof. O. S.
Fowler says: "It sometimes seems deficient,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
because the surrounding organs are large,
whereas close inspection shows it to be large.
Steady the head with the left hand, and place
the second finger of the right in the very
centre of the forehead, firmly on the head,
and then work the skin horizontally. If your
finger caresses an up-and-down ridge about
the size of a pipe-stem, this faculty is vigorous,
and has been much used and strengthened
by culture of late years. Where it is not noticeably
full, but has been taxed by business
or literary pursuits, or had a great many little
things to do for years, it appears deficient to
the eye, but the rule just given for this perpendicular
pipe-stem ridge signifies great activity
and vigor in it." (See group figure.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Words.</span> This Quality manifests in a cognizance,
appreciation and recollection of <i>words</i>,
<i>terms</i>, <i>phrases</i>, <i>etc.</i>, and their meanings.
Those in whom it is large most readily perceive,
recognize and remember the words, expressions,
gestures and other modes of communication
between the minds of men, and
are proficient not only in perceiving and understanding
them, but also in employing and
using them. It is the taste, power, and ability<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to receive verbal Impressions and to manifest
verbal Expression. It produces the orator,
and the adept in the use of words in writing.
To those persons in whom it is largely developed,
words take on life and reality, and become
living thought. In excess, it produces
verbosity, talkativeness, and "windiness" of
expression. When deficient, it renders one
unable to properly express himself. It manifests
outer form above and partly behind the
superorbital plates, which form the roof of
the sockets of the eyes, and when large tends
to press the eyes forward and downward. Its
location was discovered by Gall, who observed
that those fluent in the use of words almost
always had <i>full and prominent eyes, and</i>
<i>prominent under eye-lids</i>. The fullness of the
eyes and lower eyelids, therefore, is its distinguishing
mark.</p>

<p>Professor O. S. Fowler says: "See how
the eyes stand out beyond the cheekbone&mdash;the
best standard points from which to estimate
its size, because, though it may be large,
yet the Perceptives may be still larger, in
which case the latter will project forward still
farther even beyond large Expression.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
(Words). Hence the fullness of the eyes
should not be compared with the eyebrows as
much as <i>with the bone below them</i>, which not
being subject to kindred mutations, forms a
correct measuring point of observation."
The pressure outward of the under eyelids,
is a good sign of the development of this
Quality. It may be objected to that Quality
of Words is not, strictly speaking, a <i>Perceptive</i>,
but when it is realized that before words
may be fluently used, they must be <i>perceived</i>,
<i>recognized</i>, <i>and remembered</i>, the reason for
our inclusion of this Quality in the Perceptive
class may be understood.</p>

<small>THE REFLECTIVE QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The ninth group is known as the Reflective
Qualities, which is composed of the two following
particular Qualities: <i>Analysis</i> and
<i>Logic, respectively</i>. This group is accorded
the highest place among the mental Qualities,
for Reason is ranked higher than Emotion,
Feeling or Sentiment. Its purpose is to philosophize,
penetrate, investigate, originate,
pursue the processes of inductive and deductive
reasoning, analyze, synthesize, take apart,
put together, combine, harmonize, search for,
discover, and to manifest all the processes of
Rational Thought, using the report of the
Perceptives as "raw material." This group
manifests outer form in the upper part of the
forehead, immediately above the Reflective
Qualities. (See Fig. 10.) When large it gives
to the upper part of the forehead that appearance
of <i>intellectuality</i>, which is so commonly
recognized, and which has given rise to the
semi-slang phrase "high-brow" as applied to
persons manifesting intellect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

THE REFLECTIVE QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Analysis.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong desire to <i>analyze</i>, <i>compare</i>, <i>classify</i>, <i>infer</i>,
<i>discriminate</i>, <i>illustrate</i>, <i>etc.</i> It gathers
together the "raw material" of perception,
and proceeds to analyze and compare its particular
parts, and then to group the parts together
in a new classification and synthesis.
Those in whom it is largely developed manifest
the power of <i>comparison</i> to a high degree,
discovering points of resemblance and difference
almost intuitively. They will plunge to
the heart of a subject in a short time, and will
be able to extract the <i>essence</i> of an object or
subject with comparatively little effort.</p>

<p>Spurzheim says of it: "The great law of
this faculty seems to be to form abstract ideas,
generalizations, and harmony among the
operations of the other faculties.... It
pre-supposes, however, the activity of the
other faculties, and cannot act upon them if
they are inactive."</p>

<p>Professor Nelson Sizer says that it, "frequently
discovers unexpected resemblances
among other things, and people who have it
in a very active condition are constantly surprising
those in whom it is dull by their novel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
illustrations. It is the source of the ability
some writers possess of using frequently
metaphors and analogies.... While it
contributes to reason, it is not strictly so, <i>per
se</i>.... It endeavors to prove that one
thing is of such and such a nature, because it
resembles another that is so and so; and
because the majority of people have it fairly
developed, they are prone to convert an illustration
into an argument. It exercises a most
important influence upon the mind in the way
of analytical capability; and one who has it
largely developed is quick in discovering and
understanding differences, enigmatical assertions
and improper or inaccurate allusions;
hence it is essential to critical acumen."</p>

<p>Gall says, regarding its discovery: "I often
conversed with a philosopher endowed with
great vivacity, who, when unable to prove his
point by logic, had recourse to a comparison,
by which he often threw his opponents off the
track, which he could not do by arguments."
It tends to reason by analogy, and to make
rapid and clever generalizations. The majority
of scientists have it largely developed, as
also do discoverers in all lines of investigation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
and research, and as Gall says: "Its possessors
seize and judge well of the relations of
things, etc., and are well fitted for business."
It is attracted by investigation and thought
regarding concrete things, rather than by abstract
subjects. It is scientific, rather than
philosophical.</p>

<p>As Prof. O. S. Fowler says, it: "illustrates
with great cleverness and facility from the
known to the unknown, and discovers the
deeper analogies which pervade nature, and
has an extraordinary power of discovering
new truths. It reasons clearly and correctly
from conclusions and scientific facts up to the
laws which govern them; discerns the known
from the unknown; detects error by its incongruity
with facts; has an excellent talent for
comparing, explaining, expounding, criticising,
exposing, etc.; employs similes and metaphors
well; puts this and that together, and
draws correct inferences from them."</p>

<p>This Quality manifests in outer form in
the middle of the upper part of the forehead,
along the middle-line, just below the hair, directly
above Eventuality, and between the
two lobes of Logic (see group figure). Prof.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
O. S. Fowler says of it: "It commences at
the centre of the forehead and runs upward
nearly to the hair. When it projects beyond
surrounding organs it resembles a cone, its
apex forming a ridge which widens as it rises.
Its ample development elevates the middle of
the upper portion of the forehead, and gives
it an ascending form."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Logic.</span> This Quality manifests in a strong
desire to inquire into the "Why?" of things&mdash;into
Causes&mdash;into the "Wherefore?"; and to
reason therefrom to <i>effects</i> and application
of laws. Those in whom it is large manifest
the power of <i>logical reasoning</i> to a high degree,
and abhor fallacies. This is the <i>philosophical</i>
faculty of mind. It searches back of
facts and phenomena for <i>causes</i>, <i>motives</i> <i>and
laws</i>, and then reasons deductively from these.
Combe says: "This faculty prompts us on
all occasions to ask, "Why is this so, and what
is its object?" It <i>demands reasons and
proofs</i> in the reasoning of its owner, as well
as from others."</p>

<p>Prof. Nelson Sizer says: "It gives ability
to look deeply into subjects, and to appreciate
the logical sequences of arguments, hence it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
is large in persons who indicate genius in
metaphysics, political economy, and all sciences
of a profound character.... When
prominent, and the perceptive faculties are
moderate, and Comparison (Analysis) is not
equally influential, it tends to speculative
thinking. Men so constituted are given to
spinning improbable theories; their notions
are too abstract for ordinary minds, and they
are looked upon as dull and heavy weights in
society. On the other hand when it (Logic)
is deficient, the individual is superficial and
incapable of taking comprehensive views of
subjects; or forming judgments that will apply
to the affairs of life successfully."</p>

<p>Professor O. S. Fowler says that this Quality
gives "the desire to know the <i>why and
wherefore</i> of things, and to investigate their
laws; ability to reason from causes down to
effects, and from effects up to causes; the
therefore and wherefore; ability to adapt
ways and means to ends, to plan, contrive, invent,
create resources, apply power advantageously,
make heads save hands, kill two
birds with one stone, predict the results of
given measures, etc."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>This Quality manifests outer form in the
sides of the upper part of the forehead, one
either side of Analysis and over Locality (see
group figure). When large it gives to the
forehead a "high, bold, square" form. With
large Perceptives this Quality does not present
so prominent an appearance and so
marked a comparison, but with the Perceptives
small it gives to the brow an "overhanging"
appearance. With Analysis equally, or
nearly as strong, the fullness of course extends
well across the forehead; but with
Analysis much smaller, Logic presents a bulging
on each side of the forehead; while with
Analysis large and Logic small, the latter
gives the appearance of two depressions on
each side of the forehead.</p>

<p>Spurzheim well says of the combination
of Analysis and Logic (which he terms "Comparison"
and "Causality," respectively):
"Causality and Comparison combined constitute
Reason. Without Causality (Logic)
there can be no argumentative reasoning;
without Comparison (Analysis), no comprehensive
views, and no nice distinctions. Observation
teaches objects, and Eventuality<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
facts, while Comparison (Analysis) points
out their identity, analogy, difference or harmony,
whereas Causality (Logic) seeks their
causes, and all together discern general principles
and laws; draw conclusions, inductions
and creations, and constitute a truly philosophical
understanding."</p>

<small>THE RELIGIO-MORAL QUALITIES</small></h2>


<p>The tenth group is known as the Religio-Moral
Qualities, and is composed of the following
particular Qualities: <i>Reverence</i>, <i>Mysticism</i>,
<i>Optimism</i>, and <i>Conscientiousness</i>, respectively.
This group manifests outer form
at the front-top of the head, and on either side
thereof (see Fig. 11).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

THE RELIGIO-MORAL QUALITIES" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11</span><br />

THE RELIGIO-MORAL QUALITIES</span>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Reverence.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong reverence, respect and awe for and of
higher beings, persons in authority, sacred
things, religious ideas, constituted authority,
leaders, teachers, and heroes. It may be symbolically
expressed by the word, "Worship."
Like that of Mysticism, this Quality contains
within its field the highest and the lowest. It
manifests the reverence and veneration for
the highest conceptions of Deity and Being;
and also the fear and base servile worship of
idols, demoniac deities, devil-gods, etc. Likewise,
it manifests in respect and submission
for the lawfully constituted authorities; and
also for false leaders and prophets, charlatans
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
and imposters. In the same way it causes
a hero-worship for those who have performed
meritorious tasks and have wrought good for
the race; but also for the unworthy persons
whose sensational deeds have brought them
into the "limelight" of notoriety. It manifests
in all forms of the highest religion; and
in the lowest forms of devil-worship and low
superstitious awe and fear, in the richest religious
experiences, and in the wildest fanaticism
and hallucinations. The direction of
the manifestation is decided by the relative
development of the other propensities, particularly
those of the reasoning faculties.</p>

<p>This Quality manifests outer form on the
middle-top of the head, along the middle-line
directly in front of Firmness, back of Sympathy,
and just above Mysticism and Optimism
(see group figure). When largely developed,
it causes the middle of the top of
the head to "bulge," particularly if Mysticism
be also largely developed, the combination
usually being thus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mysticism.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong attraction for the supernatural, the
marvellous, the unknown, the mysterious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
When perverted it leads to superstition, gross
credulity, belief in witchcraft; faith in signs,
omens, and warnings, etc. When balanced by
certain other Qualities it leads one to the
higher flights of religious experience, faith,
and consciousness of the "light within;" but
when not so balanced it leads one to credulity,
superstition and religious, occult, and mystical
imposture.</p>

<p>"Psychic" phenomena are familiar to those
in whom it is largely developed in connection
with certain other mental qualities; clairvoyance,
second-sight, spirit-vision and other
peculiar experiences being common to these
people. The prophets, seers, and wonder-workers
belong to this class of "psychics."
Poets possess this Quality in many cases.
The manifestations of this Quality include
some of the very highest and the very lowest
of "spiritual" experiences and feelings. This
paradox is explained when we consider the
influence of the other Qualities, high and low,
operating in connection with that of Mysticism.
In the garden of Mysticism grow the
choicest flowers and the rankest and most
noxious weeds.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>This Quality is located immediately in
front of Optimism, and below on either side
of Reverence, on the front-upper part of the
head (see group figure). When developed it
renders the front top-head broad and prominent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Optimism.</span> This Quality manifests in a
strong tendency to look on the bright side
of things, to expect the best, to anticipate the
best. Spurzheim says of it: "Hope is necessary
to the happiness of man in almost all
situations and often gives more satisfaction
than even success. Those who are everlastingly
scheming or building castles in the air
have it large. It believes possible whatever
the other faculties desire. It is not confined
to this life, but inspires hopes of a future
state, and belief in the immortality of the soul.
When too strong it expects the unreasonable
and impossible; but when too weak, with Caution
large, it produces low spirits, melancholy
and despair."</p>

<p>This Quality when full produces optimists;
when weak, pessimists; when medium, the
average person who swings between the two
extremes partaking of the nature of each.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Those in whom it is developed to excess are
apt to see success in everything, and with a
lively imagination translate dreams into
realities; of these persons it has been said:
"show them an egg, and the next minute the
air is full of feathers." When this Quality
is weak the person is disposed to look for the
worm in the apple, decay at the heart of the
rose, and for the skeleton beneath the form
of beauty. It has been said that "the optimist
sees nothing but the body of the doughnut;
the pessimist, nothing but the hole."</p>

<p>This Propensity manifests outer form at
the middle sides of the upper head, in front
of Conscientiousness, back of Spirituality
(see group figure).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Conscientiousness.</span> This Quality manifests
in a strong tendency to act according to
truth, principle, duty, the accepted code of
ethics, conception of right, accepted religious
teachings&mdash;in short to regulate conduct according
to the particular standard of "right
and wrong" accepted by the person. Those
in whom it is large feel keenly their personal
responsibility, duty, and moral obligation.
With Reverence large, they model their stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>ard
of duty upon religious standards, while
with Reverence small, and Sociability large,
they model their standard upon social ethics,
the Brotherhood of Man, and the "social conscience."
In fact the Quality itself gives rise
to what is generally called the "social conscience."</p>

<p>Combe says of this Propensity: "After
more than thirty years experience of the
world in actual life, and in various countries,
I cannot remember an instance in which I
have been permanently treated unjustly by
one in whom this organ and intellect were
large. Momentary injustice, through irritation
or misrepresentation, may have been
done; but after correct information and time
to become cool, I have found such persons ever
disposed to act on the dictates of Conscience;
as well satisfied with justice.... It
leads to punctuality in keeping appointments
so as not to waste their time; to the ready
payment of debts; will not send collectors
away unsatisfied except from inability to pay;
are reserved in making promises, but punctual
in keeping them; and when favorably combined,
are consistent in conduct.... Its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
predominance makes a strict disciplinarian
and a rigid but just master; invests all actions
with a sense of duty; thereby sometimes rendering
estimable persons disagreeable."</p>

<p>In normal manifestation this Quality renders
its possessor a most worthy and estimable
individual; but when abnormally developed
and not balanced by judgment and the
reasoning faculties, it produces persecutors
and religious and ethical tyrants, adhering to
the letter of the law rather than to its spirit.
Conscience is generally esteemed, but careful
observers deplore the "ingrown conscience"
and "blue-law spirit" of those of large Conscientiousness,
large Destructiveness, and
small Sympathy. Many so-called "reformers"
belong to this last class. This Quality
manifests outer form on the side of the top
part of the head, just below and on either side
of Firmness. It lies between Firmness and
Cautiousness, with Optimism just in front of
it and Approbativeness just back of it (see
group figure).</p>

<small>FACES</small></h2>


<p>Next to the shape of the head, the facial
expression furnishes us with the most marked
indication of the outer form accompanying
the inner mental state. In fact, many authorities
hold that the facial expression affords
the most easily read and most comprehensive
index of character, and that, therefore,
Physiognomy possesses many points of superiority
over Phrenology. The truth seems
to be that Physiognomy and Phrenology are
twin-sciences, and that the true student of Human
Nature should acquaint himself thoroughly
with both.</p>

<p>Physiognomy is "the science and art of discovering
or reading the temper and other
characteristic qualities of the mind by the
features of the face." The philosophy underlying
the science of Physiognomy has been
stated at length in the first several chapters
of this book, the essence of which is that <i>mental
states manifest in outward form</i>. The
majority of persons apply the principles of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
Physiognomy more or less unconsciously in
judging the characters of those with whom
they come in contact. Nearly every one scans
closely the features of those whom they meet
for the first time, and form a general impression
therefrom. Children and domestic animals
possess an instinctive knowledge of
facial expression and can often tell very accurately
the general disposition toward them
possessed by various persons. Certain persons
are generally considered to "look stupid,"
while others have "a bright, intelligent
expression"; some look "tricky," while
others "look honest" and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Professor Nelson Sizer says: "Though all
human beings have the general human form
and features&mdash;though all have eyes, nose,
mouth, chin, etc., yet each one has a different
face and look from every other. And, more,
yet, the same person has a very different facial
look at different times, according as he
is angry or friendly, etc. And always the
same look when in the same mood. Of course,
then, something causes this expression&mdash;especially,
since all who are angry, friendly, etc.,
have one general or similar expression; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
is, one look expresses anger, another affection,
another devotion, another kindness, etc.
And since nature always works by means, she
must needs have her physiognomical tools.
Nor are they under the control of the will,
for they act spontaneously. We cannot help,
whether we will or no, laughing when merry,
even though in church, pouting when provoked,
and expressing all our mental operations,
down even to the very innermost recesses
of our souls, in and by our countenances.
And with more minuteness and completeness
than by words, especially when the
expressions are intense or peculiar."</p>

<p>Professor Drayton says, "Everything,
from head to feet, of form, size, and action,
indicates in some degree, the character of the
individual, or state of mind, and feeling in
exercise for the time being. The arching or
depressing of the eyebrows, the full opening
or partial closing of the eye, the pursing or
pouting of the lips, the firm set jaw, the elevated
head, the lofty shoulders, the stiff attitude,
the dignified and stately step, or the
reverse of this, will impress each observer in
respect to the changing moods which may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
exist in a given individual.... Each of
the mental organs has its natural language,
as shown in pantomine, which is exhibited by
the gestures and motions of the head, hands
and body. Children and animals read the
feelings of their parents or masters by their
motions and attitudes, which are often more
influential than words. The brain is the central
source of motive and mental power;
every action has its root or seat of impulse
in the brain and its connections, and as the
mind forms purposes, the will is sent out
to the extremities, and the external motions
express the inward thought and feeling.
Habitual states of mind tend to produce habitual
forms and expressions of face and body;
a person who suffers pain for years, will have
in the face an expression of the internal state;
one who has been nurtured in gladness,
though the face may not be beautiful, will
wear the sunshine of joy; one who has had
care and responsibility, will come to show it
in the face, in the walk, and in the voice, as
one who has been subjugated and kept subordinate
will have the word humiliation written<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
in his features not only, but in all his movements
and attitudes."</p>


<h4>SHAPES OF FACES</h4>

<p>The authorities in Physiognomy divide the
faces of persons into three general classes,
viz: (1) The Round Face; (2) The Oblong
Face; and (3) The Pear-shaped Face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 525px;">
<img src="images/i_158.jpg" width="525" height="480" alt="Fig. 12

ROUND FACE" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12</span><br />

ROUND FACE</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 12, we see the Round Face. This
face is indicative of the Vital Temperament.
It is usually associated with broad shoulders,
short neck, full chest, and plumpness, with
enlarged abdomen in middle life. These peo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>ple
love ease and physical comforts, good eating
and drinking, and not too much hard mental
or physical work. They are solicitous of
the comfort of their bodies, and generally
"look out for No. 1" in this respect. They
are generally good-natured and sociable, and
often jolly.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_159.jpg" width="480" height="573" alt="Fig. 13

OBLONG FACE" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 13</span><br />

OBLONG FACE</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 13, we see the Oblong Face. This
face is indicative of the Motive Temperament.
It is usually associated with a compact firm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
body, which while well filled out can scarcely
be called plump, certainly not fleshy. These
people are generally strong and active, persevering
and sparing neither themselves or
others in the direction of work. They are apt
to have a very fair share of common sense;
are <i>practical</i>; and are generally <i>reliable</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_160.jpg" width="480" height="556" alt="Fig. 14

PEAR-SHAPED FACE" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14</span><br />

PEAR-SHAPED FACE</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 14, we see the Pear-shaped Face.
This face is indicative of the Mental Tem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>perament.
It is usually associated with a
delicately formed body, and finely proportioned
physical shape; the shoulders often
being narrow, and the neck long. These people
manifest the characteristics of mental
and nervous force, rather than of vital or motive
energy. They often have bright, expressive
eyes, and show other signs of the artistic
or literary character. They are inclined to
be sensitive and impressionable, and to suffer
and enjoy keenly.</p>

<p>In addition to the aforementioned general
types, there are several others which are
modifications thereof, and which we shall now
consider.</p>

<p>In Fig. 15, we see the Square Face. This
face indicates a combination of the Motive
and Vital Temperaments, with the Religio-Moral
Qualities deficient and the Selfish-Qualities
predominant. These people usually
have square, stocky bodies, strong and wiry,
and are tenacious of life. They are Materialistic
to a degree, and cannot understand
others who differ temperamentally from
them. Usually, they have Combativeness and
Destructiveness large; strong Perceptive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Qualities; and but moderate Conscientiousness.
They look out for themselves, pushing
others aside, and not being disturbed by "the
higher feelings." They are generally stubborn;
and their weak point is apt to be Amativeness.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 480px;">
<img src="images/i_162.jpg" width="480" height="494" alt="Fig. 15

SQUARE FACE" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15</span><br />

SQUARE FACE</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 16, we see the Egg-shaped Face.
This face indicates the Mental Temperament
with the Psychic Qualities largely in the ascendent.
The Selfish Qualities are weak,
while the Qualities of Mysticism, Reverence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
and Ideality are large. These people are generally
known as "spiritual," and are often
very "psychic." They are generally impractical
and dwell in an ideal world apart from
the things of earth.</p>

<p>In Fig. 17, we see the Inverted-Egg-shaped
Face. This face indicates the extreme form
of the Vital Temperament, associated with
an absence of the active qualities which
should accompany it. The Mental and Motive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Qualities are quite deficient, while the purely
<i>Animal</i> Qualities are strong. The result is
a <i>pig-like</i> nature, content with wallowing in
the mud of the animal propensities and having
a full swill-barrel. These people are essentially
lazy, gross, worthless, and animal-like.
Note the large lower-face (without the
strong jaw), and the small upper head. Note
the broad nose, and general lazy expression.</p>

the contrast between Broad and Narrow
Faces. The rule is that Broad Faces indicate
fight, destructiveness, and acquisitiveness&mdash;the
Selfish Faculties, in fact; while Narrow
Faces indicate a lack of these qualities. The
broad-headed animals are the fighters, while
the narrow-heads are the timid and peaceful,
as a rule. The same principle applies in the
case of men. Look over the charts of the
Qualities, and see why this is.</p>

<p>The above mentioned several types or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
classes of faces have, of course, innumerable
variations and combinations, but a careful
study of these several types will give one the
general key to all faces. It is well to obtain a
side view, as well as a full-face view, of the
face one wishes to study.</p>

NARROW FACE</span>
</div>

<p>In studying faces, not only the general
shape of the face must be observed, but also
the various features thereof, as for instance:
the chin; the mouth; the nose; the eyes; the
ears; etc. These features form the subject of
the following chapters.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>CHINS AND MOUTHS</small></h2>


<p>Physiognomists regard the chin as an important
feature to be considered in the study
of faces as the outer form of character. The
following are the principal points of the
"reading" of chins.</p>

<p>In Fig. 20 we see the first point to be observed
in the study of chins. The rule is to
draw an imaginary perpendicular line from
the point at the root of the nose, between the
two eyebrows. In the normal and average
type, the line touches the upper lip and chin.
But we find the normal condition in but comparatively
few cases, the majority manifesting
a variation backward or forward. When
the chin is found to recede from the line, it is
interpreted as an indication of weakness, lack
of stability and firmness, and a general vacillating
and unstable character. When the chin
projects beyond the line, it is interpreted as
indicating firmness, stubborness, and a generally
selfish nature, which is considered
"strong" by contrast with the "weak" reced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>ing
chin. When the projecting chin is
<i>pointed</i>, it indicates that the strength is manifested
as grasping, miserliness, etc.; while if
it is <i>square</i>, it indicates Combativeness and
Destructiveness as well as Acquisitiveness;
and if it is <i>very broad and square</i>, it indicates
the domineering, "bossy," tyrannical, self-willed
character.</p>

CHIN STUDY</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>The above points regarding the chin must
always be taken into consideration. The following
points are based on the shape of the
chin when in <i>normal position</i>, that is when
the perpendicular line descends in a straight
line from the root of the nose to the chin:</p>

<p>The <i>narrow-round chin</i> indicates <i>idealistic
feeling</i> not manifesting in decided action.
These people have high desires, longings, and
aspiration, but lack the will to act upon the
same.</p>

<p>The <i>narrow-square chin</i> indicates the idealistic
nature, <i>accompanied by the will to act</i>
upon the same.</p>

<p>The <i>broad-round chin</i> indicates <i>substantial
feeling</i>, without the will to manifest it in decided
action. These people desire ordinary,
plain, practical things, but lack the initiative,
will and nerve to overcome obstacles to acquire
them.</p>

<p>The <i>broad-square chin</i> indicates that the
feelings are plain, practical and substantial,
<i>with the will to back them up</i>.</p>

<p>From the above, it will be seen that <i>roundness</i>
indicates <i>feeling</i>; and that <i>squareness</i>
denotes <i>will</i>; that narrowness denotes <i>ideal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>ity</i>;
while <i>broadness</i> denotes <i>practical, substantial,
plain</i> desires and tastes.</p>

<p>The <i>dimpled or indented chin</i> indicates the
warm artistic temperament with its accompanying
desire for love of the opposite sex,
desire for affection, and alas! too often a
fickleness and lack of loyalty and fidelity in
love affairs.</p>


<h4>JAWS</h4>

<p>A <i>broad, firm jaw</i> indicates strong Combativeness,
Destructiveness and Firmness.</p>

<p>A <i>narrow, loose jaw</i> indicates the reverse
of the qualities above noted.</p>

<p>A <i>loose, drooping jaw and open mouth</i> indicates
timidity, weakness, shyness, or despondency.</p>

<p>The <i>fighters</i> in all walks of life manifest the
strong, firm jaw. It is the survival of the
primitive "bite" in the animal or cave-man.</p>


<h4>MOUTHS</h4>

<p>The Orientals have a proverb which runs
as follows: "By a man's eyes, know what he
might have been, or may be; by his mouth,
knew what he has been, and is." The study
of the mouth is one of the greatest interest,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
and one which will richly repay one for his
time and thought. It will be noticed that
there is a great difference between the mouth
and lips of an individual in childhood, in
youth, and in middle-age, which fact shows
the truth of the Oriental proverb just quoted.
The mouth indeed shows what a man has been
and is.</p>

<p><i>Small mouths</i> generally denote undeveloped,
childish, or babyish character, neither
good nor bad.</p>

<p><i>Large mouths</i> denote matured character,
good or bad. When firm, they denote force
and energy. When half-open, they denote
dullness and heaviness. When showing full
protruding lips, they denote sensuality and
selfish passions and tastes. When very large
and flexible, they denote the "windy" person
who is fond of talking and hearing the sound
of his own voice&mdash;when one says that another
is "big-mouthed" he states a truth which
physiognomy bears out.</p>

<p>An <i>upward curve</i> of the corners of the
mouth, denotes a cheerful, optimistic disposition
and mental attitude. Likewise, a <i>downward
curve</i> denotes a despondent, pessimistic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
disposition and mental attitude. A graceful
bow-like curve, shows a well-balanced and
"all around" disposition.</p>

<p><i>Tightly closed lips</i> indicate a firmness, and
often a "closeness" of disposition. <i>Loosely
closed lips</i> indicate a lack of firmness, and
often a spendthrift tendency. <i>Lips that touch
lightly and protrude slightly</i> in a "kiss-like"
shape, indicate vanity, love of praise and
flattery, and often a desire to be petted.</p>

<p><i>Puffed-out lips</i> indicate sloth, dullness,
lack of energy and ambition, general heaviness.
<i>Coarse lips</i> indicate lack of refinement,
and often grossness. <i>Particularly full lips</i>
indicate Amativeness and sometimes Sensuality.</p>

<p><i>Slanting mouths</i> indicate trickiness, "foxiness"
and general unreliability. <i>Crooked
mouths</i>, or mouths greatly out of symmetry,
are held by many authorities to indicate lack
of Conscientiousness, and often criminal tendencies.</p>

<p><i>Full, red, middle-lips</i> indicate love of the
opposite sex. <i>Thin, pale middle-lips</i> denote
the opposite traits.</p>

<p><i>A long upper-lip</i> indicates Self-Esteem. <i>A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
short upper-lip</i> denotes deficient Self-Esteem,
but often also a strong Approbativeness.
(John D. Rockefeller has an almost abnormally
long upper lip.)</p>

<p>The affectionate faculties are believed to
manifest in outer form in the center of the
lips, because of certain nerve centers at that
place. A fullness and enlargement there denotes
strong affection, while deficiency in the
affectionate qualities manifest in the opposite
direction.</p>

<p>Will and self-control is shown by the relative
firmness and "set" of the lips and mouth.</p>

<p>Besides the above mentioned characteristics,
the student will soon perceive that there
are certain "expressions" of the lips and
mouth which, although impossible of expression
in words, nevertheless may be almost
instinctively recognized by the careful observer.
Lips, like eyes, tell their story plainly
to the careful and practiced observer. It is
a safe rule to <i>avoid those whose mouths
arouse an instinctive distrust in your mind</i>.
Watch closely the mouths of people speaking
to you, and you will receive many a plain signal
of danger, and many an assurance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
safety. The eyes, while full of information,
often deceive those not fully versed in their
secret code&mdash;but the mouth tells its tale in
plain, simple, understandable terms, signs and
symbols.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>EYES, EARS AND NOSES</small></h2>


<p>It has been said that "the eyes are the windows
of the soul," and indeed they do express
a <i>something</i> that is not possible to any other
part of the face or body. When unrestrained
the eye correctly portrays the innermost feelings
and emotions affecting and influencing
us, and in many cases we are able to get a
clear and unobstructed view of the soul behind
the eyes by gazing into them. But, alas!
it is possible to mask the expression of the
eyes, and to counterfeit emotions and feelings
which do not exist within the mind. Men and
women trained in the arts of dissimulation
and concealment, may, and do, conceal their
thoughts and feelings which ordinarily would
be reflected in their eyes; and many, especially
women, are able to counterfeit feelings which
have no real existence in their minds or souls.
We have seen women bestowing upon the unsuspecting
"mere man," the most artless, ingenuous
"baby stare," while at the same time
their minds were filled with craft and cun<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>ning.
We have seen others whose eyes portrayed
the most absolute innocence and truth,
while their hearts were filled with selfish, base
feelings, and their minds with cunning
schemes. The trained diplomat and skilled
gambler successfully mask their thoughts, and
their eyes reflect nothing of their secrets; and,
upon occasion, they are able to throw into
their eyes any desired expression. The best
authorities on Physiognomy hold that the
mouth is a much more reliable index of
thought and character than the eye&mdash;for the
eye may lie, while the mouth betrays itself
even when attempting the counterfeit.</p>

<p>But, nevertheless, the eyes <i>do</i> betray character,
not by their expression but by their
shape and form. Habitual mental states reflect
in the outer form of the eyes, in spite of
the care of their owners not to let them tell
the secret of the thought and feeling of the
moment. The story is told <i>not by the expression</i>
of the eye, but by the muscles surrounding
the eyes, the eye-lids, etc. In fact, the
<i>eye-lids</i> supply the greater part of that which
we call the "expression of the eye," their contractions
and relaxations producing the effect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Secretiveness, cunning, and closeness</i> are
denoted by closely drawn eye-lids, a furtive
look often being imparted thereby. This position
of the eye-lids has been likened to an
instinctive inclination to draw the eye-lids
together to hide the expression of the eye, but
it probably arises from the original trait of
the animal to protect his eyes from attack
when engaging in a fight, or raid. As an instance
of this, it will be found that a feeling
of cruelty, or desire to hurt another, will manifest
in a compression of the eye-lids, and a
tightening of the upper eyelid which assumes
a straight form. <i>Frankness, truthfulness
and honesty</i> are, in the same way, indicated by
open, free looking eyes. This expression may
be counterfeited upon occasions, but the counterfeit
may be detected by observing the eyes
when the owner is off guard.</p>

<p>The <i>fighting, destructive, motive feelings</i>
are indicated by <i>straight lines</i> of the lids.
<i>Affection, benevolence, sympathy, and love</i>,
manifest in curving, drooping, full eye-lids,
the absence of straight lines being marked.
<i>Amativeness and Alimentiveness</i> show in very
thick eye-lids, giving a sensual gross expres<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>sion
to the eyes. <i>Destructiveness</i> manifests
in a tightening of the upper lid, and a bearing
down upon the eyeball. <i>Approbativeness</i>
gives a peculiar "coquettish" relaxation of
the upper eye-lid, which is suggestive of the
desire to wink in a meaning manner. <i>Humor</i>
gives a peculiar contraction to the eye-lids,
and at the same time producing the little lines
radiating from each outer corner of the eye-lids&mdash;the
"laughing wrinkles." <i>Ideality, Optimism,
and Mysticism</i> impart an open expression
to the eyes. <i>Cautiousness</i>, when
large, also gives to the eyes an open, almost
startled, surprised expression.</p>

<p><i>Large, protruding eyes</i> are held to be indicative
of wordiness, talkativeness, and lack
of careful thought&mdash;the desire to talk for the
pleasure of hearing oneself talk.</p>

<p>In connection with the subject of the outer
form manifesting in the eyes, we would call
your attention to the quotation from Prof.
O. S. Fowler, appearing in Lesson XIII, in
which he speaks of certain of the Perceptive
Qualities which indicate in outer form in the
region of the eye, as follows: "The shape of
the eyebrows reveals the size, absolute and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
relative, of each, thus: When <i>all</i> are large,
the eyebrow is long and arching; when all are
deficient, it is long and straight; when some
are large and others small, it arches over the
large ones, but passes horizontally over those
which are small. This rule is infallible." In
connection therewith, we suggest that the
student re-read carefully Chapter XIII, which
deals with the Perceptive Qualities which
manifest outer form in the region of the eye.</p>


<h4>EARS</h4>

<p>Many physiognomists pass lightly over the
subject of the ears as an index of character,
while others seem to specialize on this feature.</p>

<p>The <i>round ear</i> is held to indicate the Vital
Temperament. The <i>oblong ear</i>, the Motive
Temperament; and the <i>pear-shaped ear</i> the
Mental Temperament.</p>

<p><i>Quality</i> is held to be indicated by the relative
delicateness in the moulding of the ear,
a coarse, misshapen ear being held to indicate
an uncultivated nature; while a delicately
moulded, shapely ear is held to indicate culture
and refinement.</p>

<p>A <i>long, narrow ear</i> is held to indicate an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
ambitious, striving nature. An ear <i>pointed
at the tip</i> (upper part) is held to be indicative
of selfishness and general "foxiness."</p>


<h4>NOSES</h4>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 640px;">

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21</span><br />

A, ROMAN; B, GRECIAN; C, CHERUBIC</span>
</div>

<p>All physiognomists agree upon the importance
of the nose as an index of character. The
majority of people recognize the sign of a
large, strong nose, on the one hand, and a
small, weak nose on the other.</p>

<p>In Fig. 21 we see the three general forms
of the nose, the Roman; Grecian and Cherubic;
respectively. The <i>Roman nose</i> is held<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to be indicative of Self-Esteem, Combativeness,
Destructiveness and Acquisitiveness.
The <i>Grecian nose</i> is held to be indicative of
Ideality, Conscientiousness, Reverence and
other "higher qualities." The <i>Cherubic nose</i>
is held to be indicative of feminine qualities,
social attractiveness, and emotional qualities.
There are of course innumerable modifications
and combinations of these three general
classes.</p>

THREE TEMPERAMENTS" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22</span><br />

THREE TEMPERAMENTS</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 22 we see the classification adopted
by some authorities, who divide the nose into
three general parts, each of which is held to
indicate one of the three Temperaments, and
the Qualities which are related to each. Thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
the hard bony part, including the bridge, indicates
the Motive; the tip and end, the Mental;
and the "wings" on each side of the nostrils,
the Vital. There is much truth in this
classification, and a careful study of this illustration
will aid the student in his understanding
of noses as an outer sign of character.
In fact, this illustration may be used as
a basis for the whole subject of the meaning
of noses as outer signs of character.</p>

<p>Large nostrils indicate strong Vitativeness
and physical well-being, and often strong
Emotive Qualities. Narrow, small, or tight
nostrils indicate weak Vitativeness and Vital
Force. An authority says: "If the nostrils
are wide-apart, the man is merciful. If the
nostrils are wide-open, like those of a bull,
resemblances to that animal prevail in violent
wrath and hard breathing."</p>

<p>The tip of the nose indicates the several
mental qualities. The sharp pointed tip indicates
an inquisitive, prying, investigating nature&mdash;a
general "sharpness" so to speak. A
blunt tip indicates a lack of "sharpness" and
inquisitiveness. The upturned tip, or "pug,"
indicates a trifling, superficial, gossiping ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>dency.
As a general rule the sharp tip indicates
thought, while the rounded tip indicates
feeling.</p>

<p>The bony part of the nose, when prominent,
indicates the strength of the Motive Qualities,
such as Combativeness, Destructiveness, Acquisitiveness,
Constructiveness, etc. It generally
accompanies the people who push forward
and "do things" in spite of obstacles&mdash;it
is the nose of the great generals, and the
majority of great financiers.</p>

<small>MISCELLANEOUS SIGNS</small></h2>


<p>While the subject of hands may be thought
to belong to the study of Palmistry, with
which we have no concern in this book, nevertheless
we think that we should include herein
a brief reference to the several classes of
the hand as indicative of the outer form of
mental states. That the shape of the hand
often reveals information regarding the character
of its owner is admitted by the best authorities
on the subject. Many persons who
discard the theories of Palmistry still regard
the subject of the shape and meaning of
hands as apart from that study, and believe
that an understanding of the indications of
the several classes of hands is important to
the students of Human Nature.</p>

<p>There are seven general types of hands, viz:
(1) The Spatulate; (2) the Square; (3) the
Artistic; (4) the Elementary; (5) the Mixed;
(6) the Philosophic; and (7) the Psychic.
Following we give a brief recital of the qualities
held to be indicated by each.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

SPATULATE HAND</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 23, we see the Spatulate Hand,
the special peculiarities of which are the
straight, smooth fingers and the "splay"
tips. This type of hand is held to indicate an
active, energetic nature, that is satisfied only
when it is employed and doing something useful.
This hand is eminently "practical," and
its owner cares very little for art, poetry, or
literature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>In Fig. 24, we see the Square Hand,
the special peculiarities of which are
its general "squareness" of the palm, and
generally of the finger-tips. This also is a
useful hand, and its owner is amenable to authority,
and makes a good employee or helper.
It indicates a quiet, peaceable disposition, and
its owner is usually found to be careful, orderly,
and dependable&mdash;the sense of <i>order</i> being
especially strong.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

ARTISTIC HAND</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 25, we see the Artistic Hand,
the special peculiarities of which are
the suppleness and softness of the hand; its
symmetrical form; and its long, tapering
fingers. Its owners are of the poetic and artistic
nature, with a taste for beautiful and refined
things, artistic environment, bright and
witty speech, and "choice" things generally.
The Qualities of Ideality and Words are apt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
to be well developed in these cases, and  "the
artistic temperament" is found in its full development
here.</p>

ELEMENTARY HAND</span>

<p>In Fig. 26, we see the Elementary Hand,
the special peculiarities of which are its short,
thick fingers, and its thick heavy palm. Its
owners are "of the earth, earthy," and have
but very little imagination and fine taste.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

PHILOSOPHIC HAND</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 27, we have the Philosophic
Hand, the special peculiarities of which
are its large thumb, rounded finger-tips, and
its projecting joints. Its owners are thinkers,
investigators, and reasoners along practical
lines, and are generally skeptical and inclined
to demand proof of anything and everything.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

PSYCHIC HAND" title="" />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 28</span><br />

PSYCHIC HAND</span>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 28, we see the Psychic Hand,
the special peculiarities of which are the
extreme slenderness of the entire hand,
and the long thin, pointed fingers. Its owners
have Mysticism highly developed, and incline
toward the mysterious, supernatural, oc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>cult,
and imaginative, and are generally of an
extremely nervous, sensitive nature.</p>

<p>Very few hands adhere strictly to any one
of these several types, but are more or less
composite or "mixed." In such cases the
characteristics of each type mingle and blend,
and must be interpreted accordingly. The
following peculiarities are also noted by the
authorities:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Thumb.</span> The thumb is divided into
three parts, each indicating a certain quality,
as follows: (1) the top part or division,
which indicates Will; (2) the second or middle
part, which indicates Logic; (3) the
"ball" or fat lower portion, which indicates
Passion. The comparative size of either of
these parts indicates the strength of its particular
qualities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fingers.</span> Hard fingers indicate work,
activity, and energy. Soft fingers indicate
love of ease, disinclination for work, laziness.
Very hard hands denote heaviness and general
stupidity, also gross tastes and undeveloped
nature. Smooth fingers denote artistic
tastes, etc.; while knotted fingers denote philosophic
thought and argument, orderliness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
and taste for material facts and things.
Short fingers denote quick judgment and impatience
of detail; while long fingers denote
a love of detail, elaboration and "fussiness."
Spatulate fingers indicate tidiness, usefulness,
and a desire to be doing useful work.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The Palm.</span> Hardness of the palm, as of
the fingers, denotes activity, energy and
work; while softness denotes love of ease, laziness,
etc. Wideness of the palm denotes
generosity, broad-mindedness, etc.; while a
narrow palm denotes the reverse. Firm
palms generally denote the Motive Temperament;
while soft, flabby palms denote the Vital
temperament.</p>


<h4>THE WALK</h4>

<p>The study of the Walk as an index of character
is favored by many authorities. There
are three general types of walks, viz (1) the
long stride, in regular time; (2) the short,
quick, and somewhat jerky step; (3) the
short but regular step.</p>

<p>Those who walk with a long stride generally
take a broad view of things, but if their
walk is also slow they are apt to lack energy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and push. The short, quick step denotes activity,
but small ideas and often pettiness.
The combination of the long stride and the
quick movement is held to indicate both large
ideas and activity. A draggy, shuffling walk
is held to indicate a careless, shiftless nature;
and a springy movement is indicative of mental
activity. A mincing walk is held to denote
"finickiness," affectation, and general artificiality;
while a careless walk denotes a disregard
for appearances and a general unconventional
nature. Those who walk in a
straight line, direct to the object they seek,
are apt to move in the same way in other affairs
of life; while those who zig-zag from
side to side display the same lack of directness
in business affairs and other activities
of life. In the same way, one who makes
short-cuts across corners, etc., is held to have
the same tendency in active affairs.</p>

<p>Approbativeness shows itself in a strutting
walk; while Self-Esteem manifests in a
dignified carriage. Deficient, Self-Esteem
shows itself in a cringing walk; while strong
Reverence produces a respectful, deferential
carriage. Approbativeness causes a slight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
swagger, with a defiant carriage of the head,
while Combativeness manifests in a "get out
of my way" pushing walk, the head being
slightly lowered as if to "butt" a way
through. Cunning manifests in a foxy, sly
walk; while Cautiousness shows in a timid,
hesitating step; and Acquisitiveness in a general
carefulness and watchfulness as manifested
in gait. A combination of Cunning,
Cautiousness and Acquisitiveness, which is
quite common, manifests in a light, stealthy
step, giving the suggestion of "tip-toeing,"
and in extreme cases may show even the
"snaky" gliding motion from side to side, in
noiseless progression.</p>

<p>A little study and observation will convince
anyone that the walk and carriage of an
individual correspond very closely to his general
character. And just as we may recognize
one's mental characteristics when reproduced
in outer form in the walk; so may we deduce
the existence of mental characteristics in a
stranger, from the outer form of his walk and
carriage. The study of walk and carriage is
very interesting, and will repay one for the
time and trouble expended upon it. One may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
practice by observing the walk of an individual
whose character is known, for the purpose
of seeing the outer form of these characteristics;
and also by observing the walk of those
whose characters are unknown, and endeavoring
to form an idea of their mental states and
characteristics by means of their peculiarities
of gait and carriage. One will be astonished
at the proficiency attained in a short time by
a little practice along these lines.</p>


<h4>VOICE</h4>

<p>The Voice is a great revealer of character.
Prof. O. S. Fowler says: "Whatever makes
a noise, from the deafening roar of sea, cataract,
and whirlwind's mighty crash, through
all forms of animal life, to the sweet and
gentle voice of woman, makes a sound which
agrees perfectly with the maker's character.
Thus the terrific roar of the lion, and the
soft cooing of the dove, correspond exactly
with their respective dispositions; while the
rough and powerful bellow of the bull, the
fierce yell of the tiger, the coarse, guttural
moan of the hyena, the swinish grunt, the
sweet warblings of birds, in contrast with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
raven's croak and the owl's hoot, each correspond
perfectly with their respective characteristics.
And this law holds equally true
of man. Hence human intonations are as superior
to brutal as human character exceeds
animal. Accordingly, the peculiarities of all
human beings are expressed in their voices
and mode of speaking. Coarse-grained and
powerful animal organizations have a coarse,
harsh and grating voice, while in exact proportion
as persons become refined and elevated
mentally, will their tones of voice become
correspondingly refined and perfected."</p>

<p>Prof. L. A. Vaught says: "Affectionate
voices always come from the backhead.
Heavy, thunderous voices always come from
the sidehead. Egotistical voices come from
the crown of the head. Kind, respectful and
straightforward voices come from the top-head."</p>

<p>A clear, distinct utterance is held to indicate
clear, logical thought, while indistinct,
confused, slurring utterance is indicative of
careless, illogical and hasty thought processes.
Sharp and shrill notes denote nervous
tension and lack of restraint, as witness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the voice of the shrew or the hysterical woman,
or the high-strung nervous man. Self-restraint
is shown by calm, deep, forceful utterances.
Slowness in delivery denotes slow,
deliberate mental processes, while quickness,
and "snappiness" in speech, denotes quick,
active habits of thought. The cheerful voice
of the optimistic person, and the rasping
whine of the chronic pessimist, are well
known. The voice of self-reliance, and the
voice of fear and lack of self-esteem, are
easily recognized. The strident, overconfident
note of the boaster and vain-glorious
person, is easily distinguished from that of
the modest, careful, reliable person.</p>

<p>All the several mental Qualities manifest
in the voice, in tone, pitch or feeling. The
Emotive Qualities give the affectionate
voice; Self-Esteem gives the confident voice;
Approbativeness gives the voice of affectation
and conceit; Combativeness gives the "let me
alone" tone; Destructiveness gives the "get
out of my way" note; Cunning and Acquisitiveness
give the tone of deceit and flattery;
and so on, through the entire scale. In studying
voices it will help you to ask "What Qual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>ity
or Qualities produce this voice?" in each
case. Study the voices of those whose characteristics
you know, and then apply the experience
to others whose characteristics are
unknown.</p>


<h4>LAUGHS</h4>

<p>Laughter is full of the expression of character.
One may often accurately determine
the character of a person whose face is not
seen or known. A hearty laugh is indicative
of sympathy, companionship and general sociability,
as well as a well developed sense
of humor. A giggle is indicative of pettiness,
trifling and general mental light-weight. The
repressed laugh shows self-control and often
caution and cunning, the tone denoting the
difference. The vulgar "haw-haw" denotes
a correspondingly gross nature. The peculiar
shrill, rasping, parrot-like laugh of the
courtesan is typical, and when ever heard
should act as a note of warning. It is difficult
to state in words the various qualities of the
laugh, but each is distinctive and well expresses
the Quality causing it. It may be
said that each and every mental Quality has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
its corresponding note in the laugh, which
note may be learned and recognized by a little
practice and actual observation.</p>


<h4>THE HAND-SHAKE</h4>

<p>The manner of shaking hands is indicative
of the characteristics of the individual.
Handshakes may be divided into three general
classes, viz, (1) the hearty handshake,
which indicates good-feeling, earnestness,
and interest; (2) the mechanical handshake,
which denotes indifference, lack of feeling,
and lack of interest; and (3) the selfish handshake,
which denotes cunning, heartlessness,
and desire and disposition to take advantage
of the other party. There is a "something"
in the handshake which is almost impossible
to express in words, but which is recognized
instinctively by those having Human Nature
well developed. It is more of a "feeling"
of certain Qualities manifested by the other
person. A little thought and attention paid
to this subject will tend to develop this recognition
on the part of one deficient in it.
One may, with a little practice, learn to distinguish
between the honest and the dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>honest;
the moral and the immoral; the active
and the passive; the energetic and the
slothful; the grasp of good-fellowship, and
that of superciliousness; the friendly and the
antagonistic; the candid and the deceitful;
and all the other various kinds of handshakes.
Mental states manifest in outer form in handshakes
as in many other physical actions and
appearances.</p>

<p>First study the several Qualities in their
inner aspect, and then learn to distinguish
the various outer forms of each. From the
inner proceed to the outer, and having
learned the way you will be able to retrace
your steps from the outer to the inner in the
case of other persons. The principle once
grasped, the rest is all a matter of practice
and experience.</p>
